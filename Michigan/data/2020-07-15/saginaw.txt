Yes. Children’s Special Health Care Services helps many families that are not receiving any other assistance from the government.  Program eligibility is based on your child’s chronic health condition, not on how much you make.  A financial assessment is completed taking into account your family size and your out-of-pocket expenses. A small percentage of families pay a small monthly fee, but the vast majority pay nothing for help from this program.Call the Children’s Special Health Care Nurse at 989-758-3896 who will consult with you either over the phone or in person.  She will discuss your concerns, give recommendations, and help refer your child to the right specialists to identify what his/her diagnosis is and how to treat it.Yes.  No information will be released to anyone without your written permission.No.  Payment is based on your income.  This is usually much less than you would pay at the doctor's office.  Depending on your income, you may only be asked to make a donation. Anyone interested in family planning services.You should plan 1 to 2 hours for an exam.  Other services will take less time.Our staff includes a Women's Health Nurse Practitioner, registered nurses, and experienced clerical and technical support staff.  There are also physicians who provide services at selected sites.Yes.  Please make this request when scheduling your appointment. The Health Department has a medical advisor, and some screenings (e.g. blood lead, vision /hearing) or physical examinations are performed in our Family Planning and STD clinics.  However, our staff does not provide physical examinations for general medical needs, e.g. work, sports, or school physicals. If you do need help with finding a physician or assistance with medical health insurance questions, we may be able to help with referral to services within the Health Department or other community agencies/resources.The Health Department offers assistance with information on head lice and other communicable diseases.  Pamphlets are available under 
Pamphlets and BrochuresHelpful websites:

   The Health Department offers free pregnancy testing for those women who have done a home pregnancy test with positive results and have need for verification purposes to obtain insurance or WIC services. Early and regular prenatal care is important in ensuring the best outcome of a healthy mother and healthy baby. A public health nurse offers education for these clients and assists with early entry into prenatal obstetrical care, as well as utilization of Health Department services related to maternal-child wellness as needed. Information on all options related to pregnancy outcome is offered.

www.marchofdimes.comThe Health Department gets many requests for speakers and participation in health fairs/community events each year and welcomes the occasion to have staff representation in the community. Community events offer the opportunity to educate the public on our services or on certain public health issues.
 
To get the best possible match for your group’s needs, all requests of this nature should be directed to the Health Promotions and Communication Department at 
989-758-3805
.The Community Resource Nurse is a Health Department liaison to the schools and community by offering information on health topics as needed for staff and students in school districts where there is no school nurse. The Community Resource Nurse also works closely with the nursing staff in districts with school nurses. The Health Department offers assistance on communicable disease information, including recommended periods of exclusion for certain communicable diseases. In most cases, your regular health care provider should be consulted for examination, diagnosis, and treatment. The Health Department can provide referral for health care services if you do not have a regular provider.
Pamphlets are available
 on the 
Pamphlets and Brochures
 page.All routine tuberculin (TB) skin testing (PPD testing) is done through the immunization department
 
(
Room 109
).
 
The test must be read 48-72 hours after testing is done for results to be valid. The Community Resource Nurse will read the test in Room 312 by feeling the site where the test was given on the arm for any raised area or swelling called induration. Redness or bruising at the site is NOT a sign of a positive test result. A positive skin test does not necessarily mean there is tuberculosis disease, but this result does warrant further assessment. If there is no induration present, the Community Resource Nurse will give the client a NEGATIVE TB TEST card to provide verification for the source requesting the testing.
Helpful website:  
www.cdc.gov./nchstp/tb/pubs/tbfactsheetsThe Health Promotions and Communication Department (Room 301) offers a wide variety of pamphlets in the areas of communicable disease, medical conditions, environmental health, substance abuse, immunizations, and family planning. A limit of 10 pamphlets per person is allowed.  The Community Resource Nurse can supplement information with data from the Internet or resources found within other divisions of the Health Department or agencies in the community.There are several locations in the Saginaw community that offer 
blood pressure screening
. The Community Resource Nurse can provide referral to support groups in the community in a variety of areas related to life experiences or disease processes.The Saginaw County Department of Public Health uses the HIV Rapid test method.  A small amount of blood is usually taken from a finger and is screened for HIV.  This test takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. The testing can be done either confidentially or anonymously.  Counseling is always done in person, both before and after the testing.  Counseling is done in order to help the client understand the factors that put them at risk for getting the virus.A positive HIV Rapid test means you may be infected with HIV.  If the Rapid test is positive, a confirmatory test will be done to verify the presence of HIV.  Occasionally a positive Rapid test is inaccurate due to other conditions so the 
confirmatory
 test is done to verify the presence of the HIV virus.  Confirmatory tests can take up to two weeks to complete.  An appointment will be made with the client to return for the test result.No.  A 
positive 
confirmatory
 test
 means you have become infected with the virus.  Some people who have tested positive for HIV have gone on to develop AIDS while others have not yet developed AIDS.  It may take several years to develop AIDS, especially if you maintain a healthy lifestyle and make behavior changes.  Also, if you have the HIV virus, early medical treatment can help delay or avoid the development of AIDS.  The Saginaw County Health Department can make referrals to health care providers in the area who specialize in HIV care.Although it is 
very
 possible to get the virus from having sex with someone with HIV, this is not always the case.  Using condoms correctly each and every time you have sex can help reduce the spread of HIV.  Also, if a person with HIV takes medication to reduce the viral load (the amount of the virus in the body) they also reduce the chances of spreading the virus.It takes a 
minimum
 of 15 days after a possible exposure to tell if a person has the HIV antigen.  Having the HIV antigen indicates a
 
very early
 HIV infection.  Our tests look for both the HIV antigen and HIV antibodies.  Having the HIV antibody indicates a person has an established or less recent infection.  Detecting the virus 
very early
 can help a person get into medical care earlier which can lead to a much healthier and longer life.  For more information, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website: 
http://www.cdc.gov/hivLocal reactions (swelling, redness, and soreness) where the shot was given can happen. Usually this can be relieved with a cool wet cloth and/or a non-aspirin pain medication such as Tylenol.  Call your healthcare provider for the right dosage for your child.  Encouraging your child to move the arm and/or leg where the shot was given (exercise) is also helpful in preventing stiffness that can sometimes happen after getting a shot. Other reactions (fever, rash, joint aches and stiffness) are less common.  These types of reactions may not be seen until 10-14 days after getting a shot.  A non-aspirin pain reliever is helpful in reducing the fever and stiffness.  An anaphylactic reaction is very rare.  Difficulty breathing, wheezing, and pallor are signs of this type of reaction, and it is most often the result of an allergy to the vaccine or vaccine component.MCIR stands for “Michigan Care Improvement Registry”.  MCIR is a nationally-recognized electronic statewide immunization registry that is accessible to both private and public providers.  Providers are highly encouraged to report adult immunizations to MCIR.  Providers are still required to report childhood immunizations to MCIR within 72 hours of administration.It is best to return to the provider who gave your child his/her shots.  If this is not possible, the shot record may be found on the MCIR.  You may wish to contact your child’s school or the Board of Education in your child’s school district to determine if a shot record is on file there. You can get a copy of the MCIR shot record at your child’s healthcare provider’s office, or at the Health Department.A Tb (Tuberculosis) skin test is a screening test used to see if a person may have been exposed to the germ that causes Tuberculosis (a lung disease). A small amount of clear liquid (purified protein) is placed under the top layer of skin on the left forearm.  It will then look like a small welt (“wheel” or “bump”).  This small bump under the skin will usually fade within a couple of hours.  It is important that you return to the clinic within 48-72 hours after the test is done, so your arm can be checked for signs of a positive reaction.  You will be given a card as proof that the test was done, and the result of the test (“read”) at this time. A Tb screening test is available at all SCHD Immunization Clinics, with the exception of 
St. Charles Health 
Center. The cost of this testing is $15.00.  Only Medicaid insurance is accepted at SCHD for this test.  All others will be charged $15.00.STD stands for
 
S
exually
 
T
ransmitted
 
D
isease.  STDs are infections spread through sex or intimate contact with an infected sex partner. The germs causing the infections prefer to live and multiply in the sex organs (penis and vagina), but occasionally can be found in the mouth or rectum (butt) after having oral or rectal sex.   STDs are dangerous infections that can cause long term damage to a person’s reproductive system, heart, bones and brain if not treated.  STDs are
 
not
 spread on toilet seats or through casual contact (i.e.; hugging, kissing, shaking hands, etc.) with a person, even if they are infected.Many people with STDs have symptoms but some do not.  Some infections may not show symptoms for months or years while others may show symptoms within days.  Common symptoms in
 
women
 include: unusual discharge or odor from the vagina, pain in the lower abdominal (belly) area, burning or itching around the vagina, unusual vaginal bleeding or spotting, pain deep inside the vagina during sex.  Common symptoms in 
men
 include: pain, discharge,or dripping from the penis.  Symptoms seen in 
both men and women 
include:  sores, bumps or blisters around the sex organs, mouth or rectum; burning or pain during urination (peeing), itching around the sex organs, swelling in the groin; swelling or redness in the throat; flu-like symptoms with fever, chills and aches.If you have
 
any
 of the above symptoms, especially if you have a new sex partner, have multiple (more than one) sex partners 
or 
your sex partner has other sex partners, you may be infected.  GET TESTED!  Most STDs can be detected by testing a sample of urine, discharge from the penis or vagina, or by taking a blood sample.  The Saginaw County Health Department STD Clinic can test for gonorrhea, Chlamydia, syphilis, herpes, and HIV.  Women can also be tested for trichomonas.   Unfortunately, trichomonas is very hard to detect in men but we do provide treatment referrals for all sex partners exposed to any of the above infections.Yes and No.  Condoms can protect against
 
some
 
STDs
 
if
 
used properly
 
and 
used
 
every time
 
you have sex.  Unfortunately, some infections are spread through intimate skin-to-skin contact and sometimes condoms break.  Still, condom use is very important, especially if you or your sex partner have multiple sex partners, but remember
 
condoms are not a guarantee
 against infection.There is a cure for some STDs but not others.  Infections caused by bacterial-type germs are curable with antibiotics.  These infections include gonorrhea, Chlamydia and syphilis.  On the other hand, infections caused by viruses are not.  Viral sexually transmitted infections include herpes, HIV and human papilloma virus (ie: HPV or warts).  There are medications used to help keep viral infection symptoms under control but they do not kill the germs that cause the infection.  Therefore, symptoms may reoccur in the future.For more information, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disease facts and information website:

Please contact the Health Department at our designated COVID-19 line, 989-758-3828, option 1.  Do NOT send individuals to the Health Department for testing.  A physician or primary care provider must provide an order for testing. The Health Department is not providing testing services at this time.The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from mild disease with non-specific signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness, to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and septic shock. There have also been reports of asymptomatic infection with COVID-19.Currently, those at greatest risk of infection are persons who have had prolonged, unprotected close contact with a patient with symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 and those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission.The available data are currently insufficient to identify risk factors for severe clinical outcomes. From the limited data that are available for COVID-19 infected patients, and for data from related coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is possible that older adults, and persons who have underlying chronic medical conditions, such as immunocompromising conditions, may be at risk for more severe outcomes.The onset and duration of viral shedding and period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infection with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, but it is not yet known what role asymptomatic infection plays in transmission. Similarly, the role of pre-symptomatic transmission (infection detection during the incubation period prior to illness onset) is unknown. Existing literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2–14 days.Very limited data are available about detection of SARS-CoV-2 and infectious virus in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but whether infectious virus is present in extrapulmonary specimens is currently unknown. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer, which has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, in contrast – viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2.The immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood. Patients with MERS-CoV infection are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19.Although the transmission dynamics have yet to be determined, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. Healthcare personnel evaluating PUI or providing care for patients with confirmed COVID-19 should use Standard Transmission-based Precautions.No. These multi-pathogen molecular assays can detect a number of human respiratory viruses, including other coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory illness, but they do not detect COVID-19.Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted.Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended for viral pneumonia or ARDS and should be avoided unless they are indicated for another reason (e.g., COPD exacerbation, refractory septic shock following Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines).There are currently no antiviral drugs licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat COVID-19. Some 
in-vitro
 or 
in-vivo
 studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of some agents against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from observational studies or randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, was reported to have in-vitro activity against COVID-19. A small number of patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting
. A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivirexternal icon
 for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory disease has been implemented in China. 
A randomized open label trialexternal icon
 of combination lopinavir-ritonavir treatment has been also been conducted in patients with COVID-19 in China, but no results are available to date. trials of other potential therapeutics for COVID-19 are being planned. For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection, see 
clinicaltrials.govexternal icon
.See 
Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate isolation precautions. Some patients with an initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in monitoring, the ability for safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. For more information, see 
Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Known or Patients Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting
 and 
Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
.Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital Transmission-Based Precautions described below.Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 in respiratory specimens.Criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions can be found in:

With more businesses opening and planning  for gradual reopening, the following will help provide an overview for owners and managers.Overview Guide for Reopening Businesses (pdf)Through collaboration with several local health departments around the state, the Saginaw County Health Department has assembled a comprehensive toolkit of resources for businesses to use as they plan for re-opening, including public health guidance for many different industry sectors.
 
We invite you to share this 
toolkit
, asking you to recognize it as a fluid document that will change as management and mitigation of COVID-19 changes in our state.In accordance with the latest Executive Order issued by Governor Whitmer, 
businesses that are able to 
open are required to develop a COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan. This is a printable template that will satisfy this requirement.COVID-19 Preparedness and Response PlanAs our County's businesses begin to return to work, building owners and operators must be prepared to ensure that their water systems are safe to use after prolonged shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires' disease and other disease causes by waterborne pathogens.Guidance for Reopening Buildings After Prolonged Shutdown or Reduced Operation
 outlines an 8-step checklist and was developed with the help of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the CDC.  If Saginaw County business have questions about water safety in their facilities, we encourage them to call our hotline at (989) 758-3828.As fitness centers including gymnasiums, recreation centers, sports facilities, exercise facilities, and exercise studios begin to open, please follow the following guidelines from MIOSHA.

Encourage those you serve to establish a "buddy" system, wherein community members can check on and help care for someone if they become sick. Special consideration should be given to communicating risk to vulnerable populations in your community, including older adults and those with access and functional needs.Address the potential fear and anxiety that may result from rumors or misinformation, and remind those you serve to "unplug" periodically. Taking breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories and social media can help alleviate some of the stress a pandemic can bring.  Encourage your members to follow the shelter in place order and to practice good hygiene with proper hand washing and social distancing.Our Environmental Health Department can help you with general cleaning and disinfecting questions. Give us a call at 989-758-3686.For more information, you can also consult the CDC recommendations found 
here
.Have an emergency operations plan in place. This includes promoting the practice of everyday preventive actions with those you serve and staff, providing COVID-19 supplies at your organization (e.g. hand soap, sanitizer, tissues), planning for staff and volunteer absences, and being prepared to assist individuals who develop severe illness so that they can receive appropriate medical care. If possible, identify a space that can be used to accommodate clients with mild respiratory symptoms and separate them from others. Designate a room and bathroom (if available) for clients with mild illness who remain at the shelter and develop a plan for cleaning the room daily.Plan for higher shelter usage during the outbreak, and identify other places to refer clients if your shelter space is full. Identify short-term volunteers to staff shelter with more usage or alternate sites, and consider the need for extra supplies on hand.Additional guidance can be found 
here
.If you are in need of critical supplies or services to help serve individual patients, staff, or members of your community, please report this need to Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC). PMBC is collecting data in order to help you source these needs and services in Michigan. You can find them 
here
.More detailed recommendations can be found below:In addition to the guidance given under the Community Organizations/ Associations/Charities FAQ of the same title, consider implementing alternative meeting and service options. For example, mailed newsletters, pre-recorded messages from trusted leaders on a designated call-in telephone number, and printed copies of daily teaching guides may be options, especially to reach those without internet access.For religious services, give people the option to watch online (live or recorded), if possible.Additional guidance can be found at the CDC website

.COVID-19 is caused by a new respiratory virus. The virus began circulating in humans in December 2019. Health experts are concerned because little is known about this new virus and it has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia.Symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus. They include:Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death.Health experts are still learning about how this new coronavirus spreads. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person:If you are traveling domestically or overseas, follow the CDC's guidance at 
www.CDC.gov/Travel
.There are steps you can take to prevent the spread of flu and the common cold that will also prevent COVID-19, including:Recent studies show that a significant portion of individuals with COVID-19 lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.In light of new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19 in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.Maintaining 6-feet minimum social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of COVID-19. CDC also advises use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure to help slow the spread of COVID-19.The cloth face coverings recommended to slow spread of COVID-19 are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those critical supplies must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.Individuals that are concerned about their health and experiencing respiratory illness or other serious or concerning symptoms should contact their healthcare provider for further guidance. Healthcare providers request testing based on a patient's signs, symptoms, travel history, and risk.Testing remains somewhat limited at this time, although capabilities are expanding. If your symptoms are mild, stay home and isolate yourself as much as possible to prevent spread. If you develop difficulty breathing or have a sustained high fever that does not respond to medication, seek medical care and guidance from your provider. Do not show up at your provider's office, the local health department, an urgent care or the emergency room without calling ahead. If you feel it is a medical emergency, contact 911 and notify dispatch personnel that you may have COVID-19.  While capabilities continue to expand, a prioritization schedule of testing resources remains in place. You can view that schedule 
here
. If you are not experiencing symptoms, you do not need to, and will not be, tested. If you develop symptoms, please follow the guidance in the "I feel sick, and am showing some of the symptoms" question.Contact any primary care physician first. If they are not available, contact a local urgent care.Great Lakes Bay has also set up a specific number for new patients wanting to establish care in relation to COVID-19. New patients or people with no primary care provider wanting to establish care related to COVID-19 symptoms and/or known exposure, please call 989-753-6000 for assistance.Recently, Rite Aid Pharmacy on State Street in Saginaw has begun facilitating a self-swabbing drive-thru option for those showing symptoms. Anyone wanting to be screened can go online 
here
 to see if they meet qualifications for testing.We do not have test kits here at SCHD and are not testing individuals for COVID-19 at this time. All questions related to test results should be directed to the physician who ordered the test. Older individuals and persons with pre-existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer, or diabetes appear to develop serious illness more often than others. The risk also increases depending on where you are - and more specifically - whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. Follow restrictions on gatherings, practice social distancing recommendations where possible, clean surfaces around you and in your home frequently, and practice proper hand washing procedures frequently to limit your risk. Create a household emergency plan of action and follow all hygiene recommendations.

The MI Safe Start Roadmap contains recommendations and guidelines outlined for schools to follow as they plan on returning to the classroom this fall including guidance on wearing masks, hygiene and cleaning protocols, athletics, and more.  School districts will be required to adopt a COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan laying out how they will protect students and educators across the various phases of the Michigan Safe Start Plan, with in-person instruction allowed if we are minimally in Phase 4.MI Safe Schools Roadmap Child care providers across the state have always prioritized the health and safety of the children in their care. With the spread of COVID-19, new health and safety protocols are necessary to ensure children, families, and staff members are as safe as possible. This document provides tools to help you make the best decisions possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 and to create safe spaces for children and staff members.LARA Guidelines for Safe Child Care Operations During COVID-19    The Michigan Department of Education (MDE) has created an online map with locations where meals are being provided.

You are being monitored because of your recent exposure to a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19. This puts you at risk of developing a COVID-19 infection. Over the next 14 days, you need to monitor for symptoms that indicate a COVID-19 infection. This monitoring is a precautionary measure to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19. It does NOT mean you have COVID-19 or that you will get COVID-19.Reporting your temperature and your symptoms helps determine the presence of a COVID-19 infection. It is very important for you to monitor your health so that you can be tested for COVID-19 and receive appropriate medical care should you need it. Based on what is known about coronavirus infections, 14 days is the longest time between when you were last exposed to novel coronavirus and when symptoms begin.Signs and Symptoms of Novel Coronavirus:These symptoms can be due to many other illnesses. If you develop a fever or any symptoms, it doesn't mean you have COVID-19, but you should follow up with staff at the Saginaw County Health Department (SCHD).If you do become ill during this monitoring period, do NOT go to a clinic or hospital without first calling ahead, if possible. If you call 911, inform them you are being monitored for COVID-19 and need follow-up medical care and testing.Instructions for Home Quarantining:Instructions for Monitoring:Click
