On Mon, June 15, Washtenaw County officially reopens. 
At the Health Department, we will continue to focus much of our attention on COVID-19. Other services will also resume. Clinical services will be by appointment only, and we will continue to respond to COVID questions and concerns. 
For most questions, please use
 734-544-6700 and leave a message. Or, email 
l-wchdcontact@washtenaw.org
. There is 
evidence of community spread locally
. Residents can assume there is a possibility the virus may be present when they are in public places in the community. The Health Department is not announcing evidence of community spread to cause panic, but to reinforce that people should be taking all recommended prevention measures.Case Updates:We’re relying on our community to work together to slow the potential spread of illness and refer to official sources of reliable information.REMEMBER
: Discrimination harms public health. We know viruses do not discriminate based on location, race, ethnicity, or national origin. However, viruses like COVID-19 can highlight health disparities that are deeply rooted in our society. Let’s fight this public health concern with compassion and science, not fear and discrimination. For clinical services, animal bites or COVID questions, call 734-544-6700 or

You can use these scales to consider some of the many factors that could contribute to the risk of an activity. The more low-risk choices you make, the more protection you have from getting or spreading COVID-19. If you’re seeing people, talk to them about how you can stay on the greener side of these categories.

 Practice social distancing when out. 
Social distancing means keeping at least six feet between people as much as possible.Wear a face covering
Cover your face when out in public, 
especially if you’re in an enclosed space or you’re likely to come within 6 feet from others. 
Under the Governor’s 
executive order 2020-77
, any individual able to medically tolerate a face covering must wear a covering over his or her nose and mouth when in any enclosed public space, like the grocery store or pharmacy.
Learn how to make and wear your own cloth face covering.
 
Given the current shortage of masks, we should make sure our healthcare workers and first responders are prioritized when it comes to surgical and N95 masks. 
If you are sick:
 You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room.

UPDATED July 15, 2020 at 9:30 a.m.Testing is available from local health care providers and according to 
state criteria
. If you have a health care provider, contact them about testing or see the information below. There is also a 
statewide testing locator
.See this flyer for more information on what to do after you get tested.You will be contacted when your results are available. Note that results sometimes take a bit longer than expected. 
Contact your primary care provider for results, or the health care facility where you got tested. We will not be able to provide you with results.The Washtenaw County Health Department is only notified of positive test results for Washtenaw County residents. We typically are not notified of negative results. If you do not live in Washtenaw County, we will not have your information - even if you took your test here. Contact the local health department where you live for help.If you test positive for COVID-19, you should stay home except for medical care, and away from others in your household as much as possible. See our 
what to do if you’re sick page
 for information on isolating, managing your symptoms, and when to seek medical care. Health Department staff will be in touch with you to connect you with needed resources during isolation and conduct contact tracing to make sure people you’ve had close contact with go into quarantine. Pick up the phone if we call you to help us slow the spread of COVID-19! We will NEVER ask you for social security, credit card, bank account, or immigration status information. Learn more about how 
contact tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19
.You are considered recover after you’ve gone 3 days with no fever, your symptoms have improved, and it has been 10 days since your symptoms first appeared. If you never had symptoms, follow the above guidance for 10 days after your test.A negative diagnostic test only means you were not infected on the day of the test. There have also been reports of false negatives. Continue to practice prevention measures to protect yourself and others, especially if you are feeling sick or had known exposure to COVID-19.Contact your primary care provider for this information, or the health care facility where you got tested.Antibody testing is not currently recommended to make health-based decisions on an individual basis (like returning to work). It is unclear if these tests are accurate or if they tell us anything about immunity to COVID-19. The Health Department does not recommend antibody testing at this time. If you do seek an antibody test, you should also get a diagnostic/PCR test.Additional studies are needed to understand what antibody level, if any, would mean an individual is “immune” to COVID-19 disease - and for how long that immunity may last. If someone has antibodies, we don’t know if that means the person won’t get sick if exposed to someone infected with COVID-19. We also don’t know if it means they will - or won’t - be able to transmit the virus to someone else. Until we better understand the virus, we can’t rely on antibody testing to make individual return-to-work decisions.You can also check with your health care provider for their perspective on use of antibody tests. These companies offer COVID-19 antibody testing. Note that we do not endorse these companies or recommend this testing; this information is provided as a reference.See our diagnostic and antibody testing FAQs document

UPDATED July 9, 2020 at 6:30 p.m.Contact tracing is one way to help prevent further spread of COVID-19. Contact tracing can help contain outbreaks by quickly alerting people who may have had a high-risk exposure, so they don’t spread the virus to others. Washtenaw County Health Department investigates every reported case of COVID-19 and that person’s close, personal contacts.A close contact is someone who had face-to-face contact with an infected person for more than 15 minutes.Here’s what you need to know about how you can help the Health Department with this important work.We’ll contact you if you test positive for COVID-19. We’ll also be in touch if we’ve found through case investigations that you’ve been in close contact with someone who’s tested positive for COVID-19.We’re not spying on you or tracking your cell phone data, we promise. Health care providers, testing sites, and employers are required to report positive COVID-19 cases to the public health department. We will call you from that information. If you’ve tested positive, we’ll ask you for the contact information of people you’ve been in close contact with so we can talk to them as well. The Michigan Department of Corrections or other local health departments may also provide us with your contact information if you live in Washtenaw County.We want to make sure you have all the resources you need to isolate (if you’re sick) or quarantine (if you’ve been exposed but are not yet sick).

Additionally, employers must protect the confidentiality of their employees. Legally, they cannot identify an employee who has COVID-19 by name.All Health Department staff have access to phone interpreters. We have some staff who speak other languages.Pick up the phone
 if we call you or call us back as soon as you can. The call may come from different numbers, depending on which staff member is calling.
