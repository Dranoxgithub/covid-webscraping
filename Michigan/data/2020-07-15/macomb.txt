Macomb County Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Readiness Public Health Update


The Macomb County Health Department is working closely with community partners, healthcare providers, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to actively monitor and respond to COVID-19. There are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Macomb County.


“The Coronavirus outbreak is a rapidly evolving public health situation, and we'll continue to provide updated information as it becomes available,” said William Ridella, director/health officer, Macomb County Health Department. “We encourage residents, schools, businesses, municipalities and other organizations to take a proactive approach for the possibility of the virus spreading. Residents can practice everyday prevention measures like frequent hand washing, staying home when sick and covering coughs and sneezes to safeguard ourselves, our families and our communities.”


The Macomb County Health Department is involved in the following activities for COVID-19 prevention, education, and surveillance:




Developing educational materials and information for prevention efforts, including ongoing updates to the Health Department website at 
https://health.macombgov.org/Health-Programs-DC-Coronavirus
. Additional information can also be accessed at 
www.michigan.gov/coronavirus
, and 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/


Providing information to community partners including schools, healthcare providers, and businesses about what they can do to help prevent the spread of illness and prepare for potential cases of COVID-19.


Collaborating with MDHHS and other local health departments to ensure an ongoing exchange of information.


Daily monitoring of travelers who meet CDC risk criteria and enhanced communicable disease surveillance protocols.


Handling inbound phone calls and emails from Macomb County citizens, schools, and businesses with questions relating to COVID-19.




In addition, the Health Department has assembled a cross-departmental leadership and response team to coordinate prevention and mitigation activities.


Prevention


The Macomb County Health Department recommends the following prevention tips:




Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.


Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, throw the tissue in the trash, and then wash your hands.


Staying home when sick except to get medical care.


Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.


Avoid close contact with people who are sick.


Avoid sharing cups, drinking bottles, utensils and eating food from the same dish.


Clean and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.


Practice good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food.


If anyone believes they have symptoms and have recently traveled to China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, or other destinations with risk of community spread, or have been in contact with someone who has had the virus, they should promptly call their healthcare provider or hospital prior to arriving so that the appropriate preventive measures can be put in place.




Be prepared with the following supplies:




Maintain a two-week supply of water and food at home, and routinely check your regular prescription drugs to ensure that you won’t run out.


Keep non-prescription drugs and other health supplies on hand.


Get copies and maintain electronic versions of health records.


Talk with family members about how they would be cared for if they got sick and what would be needed to care for them in your home.
