Social Distancing








Page Content




















What You Need to Know




Social distancing means keeping a physical separation from other people. This includes avoiding groups of people and keeping space between yourself and others.


It can include larger measures like closing public spaces and canceling group events. It helps protect people from illness, especially those who are more vulnerable.


Social distancing limits the spread of disease by lowering the chance of contact with someone with COVID-19.










Everyone Should




Stay home when sick.


Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when you have to go out in public. Maintain 6 feet between yourself and others. A cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing. Wash regularly in the washing machine.


Keep six (6) feet between yourself and others. Avoid getting together in social groups and gatherings.


Avoid hugging, high-fives, shaking hands, and sharing cups or eating utensils.


Use Skype and FaceTime to visit family and friends.


Use online, curbside, or drive-through services such and banking, groceries, pharmacy and carryout.


Avoid public places at their busiest times.


Use good personal hygiene practices whenever you are out in public:


Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, or cough/sneeze in your upper sleeve.
Immediately throw away used tissues in the trash, then wash hands.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as toys and doorknobs.

Stop the Spread of Germs








Page Content
Text OAKGOV to 28748 to subscribe to receive COVID-19 updates


You can take steps to protect yourself and others during a COVID-19 outbreak. The virus spreads from person-to-person in close contact and being exposed to the virus on surfaces, then touching your face with unwashed hands. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.
The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.


























Wash Your Hands




Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.


If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.


Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.










Clean / Disinfect Hard Surfaces




Hard surfaces that are touched often or by more than one person need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly.


When a surface is visibly dirty, wash with a general household cleaner (soap or detergent). Rinse with water and follow with a disinfectant.


When a surface is not visibly dirty, clean with a commercial product that is both a detergent (cleans) and a disinfectant (kills germs).


Wear disposable gloves.










Wear a Cloth Face Covering


Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others.




You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. Everyone should 
wear a cloth face cover
 when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities.


Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker.


Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.










Cover Your Cough / Sneeze




Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash.


Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.










Stay Home When You're Sick




Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.


Call ahead before you visit your doctor or emergency room.


If you are sick wear a cloth covering over your nose and mouth.


Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider and 
monitor your symptoms
.

Cleaning & Disinfecting Hard Surfaces








Page Content
Text OAKGOV to 28748 to subscribe to receive COVID-19 updates




















What should be used to clean and disinfect hard surfaces?


When a surface is visibly dirty, wash with a general household cleaner (soap or detergent). Rinse with water and follow with a disinfectant. When a surface is not visibly dirty, clean with a commercial product that is both a detergent (cleans) and a disinfectant (kills germs). Wear disposable gloves. Make sure the disinfectant product you choose is registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and includes an 

EPA registration number
 on it.

Please Note:




Minimum disinfectant concentrations are needed for different bacteria/viruses and surfaces. In general, a bleach concentration of 200 parts per million (1 tablespoon of bleach in one gallon of water) is effective against many bacteria and viruses. Bleach solution of 1,000 – 5,000 parts per million (1/3 cup to 1 2/3 cups of bleach in 1 gallon of water) may be needed to be effective against Norovirus. For more detailed information visit the EPA disinfectant web page at: www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.html.


When using chlorine bleach to disinfect surfaces, use an unopened bottle. Chlorine bleach loses its effectiveness 30 days after opening. A fresh bleach/water solution should be made daily. Spray or use a cloth to apply to surfaces and let stand for 10 minutes if possible. Rinse with clear water.


Always follow label instructions carefully when using cleaners and disinfectants. Pay attention to hazard warnings and label instructions for using personal protective items such as household gloves.




DO NOT MIX DISINFECTANTS AND CLEANERS












What surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected?


Hard surfaces that are touched often or by more than one person need to be cleaned and disinfected as explained above. Examples of hard surfaces include:




Countertops


Tabletops


Doorknobs/door handles


Toys


Desktops


Chairs


Bathroom surfaces


Drinking fountains




Use sanitizer cloths on electronic items that are touched often. These items include computers, keyboards, computer mice, telephones, remote controls, light switches, doorknobs and hand-held video games. Also use sanitizer cloths on car door handles, steering wheels, and gear shifts in vehicles.

Children / Parents








Page Content
CDC Information About Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome


Families across the country are adapting to the evolving changes in daily life caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only are parents trying to keep children occupied and entertained, but also helping children understand the pandemic.
It is very important to remember that children look to adults for guidance on how to react to stressful events. Acknowledging some level of concern, without panicking, is appropriate and can result in taking the necessary actions that reduce the risk of illness.
How should I answer my child's questions about the Coronavirus (COVID-19)?
When talking to your child about COVID-19 remain calm and reassuring.
Keep information age and developmentally appropriate. Here are 
      


some tips from the National Associations of School Psychologists and School Nurses
.
Be honest with your child about what is happening.
Avoid 
      
language that creates stigma and blame towards certain groups of people
.
Let your children know their feelings are normal and you are there to answer their questions.
Let them know things they can do to stay safe like washing their hands, covering their mouth when they cough, and talking with friends virtually or by phone.
Additional resources to help you talk to your child about COVID-19
Easterseals has created a book to 
      
help explain COVID-19 to young children


CDC: Talking with children about Coronavirus Disease 2019: Messages for parents, school staff, and others working with children


KidsHealth: Coronavirus (COVID-19) How to talk to your child


HealthyChildren: 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 My child is more emotional recently. Is this normal?
Anxiety and fear are normal during this time even for children. Every child is different, and they will show their stress in different ways.
Common behavior changes you may notice include:
Excessive crying or irritation in younger children
Toileting accidents or bedwetting
Irritability or “acting out” in teens
Difficulty concentrating
Unexplained headaches or body pain
As a parent or guardian, you can:
Take time to answer your child or teenager’s questions about the outbreak. Use 
         
KidsHealth
, the Centers for Disease Control & Infection, and Healthy Children by the American Academy of Pediatrics tips to navigate questions and concerns from children and teens.
Reassure your child that they are safe.
Maintain regular routines, like bedtime, meals, physical activity, and family time, while allowing some flexibility. Physical and mental health needs can change, and you may need to adapt your schedule occasionally.
Be a role model for how to handle stressful experiences. If you are showing you are overly worried or anxious, this may cause your child to become more anxious too. Seek out support for yourself if you are struggling during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Monitor their media exposure- much of the news on TV is intended for an adult audience and can be overwhelming and scary for a younger viewer.
If your child has a pre-existing mental health condition, please continue their treatment and watch for new or worsening symptoms. If you notice anything changing with your child, contact their healthcare or mental health provider.  Oakland Community Health Network has a crisis hotline open 24/7: 800-231-1127.
My daycare is closed, and I need help finding childcare.
If you are a first responder, healthcare worker, or 
   
other essential (critical infrastructure) staff
, 
   
the State of Michigan is working to ensure frontline and essential workers have access to childcare
.  If you are deemed an essential worker and your own childcare provider is closed, 
   
complete this form to help find childcare near you
.
If you need help finding childcare after the “
Stay Home, Stay Safe
” order is lifted you can contact Great Start to Quality, which is available for any family in Michigan to help find quality and affordable childcare.  Call the local resource center at 877-614-7328 to help start your search.
What can I do with my child while school is closed?
Children thrive on routine. It is important to maintain a routine with your child during this time. Include your child in setting their daily schedule while school is closed. Remember to be flexible with scheduling to meet changing physical and mental health needs.
If your child is school-aged, check to see what resources their teachers or school district has suggested or provided during “
Stay Home, Stay Safe
.”
Check with your child’s school to see how meals will be provided during school closure.  Michigan Department of Education has a map showing sites serving free school lunches. 
      
Find one near you
!
United Way of Southeastern Michigan has a list of 
      
online educational resources for children
.
Have puzzles, crafts, books, and other hands-on activities available for your child.
Use social media and video chats to connect your child with friends and family.
Help your child stay active by going outside. Spending time outside is good for physical and mental health. Remember to 
      
practice social distancing
 and avoid playground equipment.
Engaging in healthy behaviors during this outbreak will help the whole family stay healthy, physically and mentally, during this outbreak.
Can I set up a playdate for my child while school is closed?
It is not recommended to have a playdate with other families at this time. Governor Whitmer on March 23, 2020 announced a 
   
"Stay Home, Stay Safe" order
. All Michigan residents should refrain from all non-essential activities until the order is lifted. Essential activities include going grocery shopping or picking up food, obtaining medication, walking or riding bikes outdoors, and going to work if you an essential worker.
Avoid gatherings of children or adults outside of your immediate family (immediate family is your children, spouse, or partner or those you are currently living with at home). If children meet outside of school in bigger groups, it can put everyone at risk.  Oakland County Health Division Health Officer Leigh-Ann Stafford on March 21, 2020 
   
issued emergency orders
 that closed playgrounds and shopping malls to protect Oakland County residents and reduce social gatherings. These orders are in place to help prevent spreading COVID-19.
How does COVID-19 affect children?
There is much we still need to learn about how COVID-19 affects children. While some children and infants been sick with COVID-19, most illnesses have been among adults. Some reports suggest that infants under 1 year old and those with 
underlying medical conditions
 might be higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 than other children.
Children with COVID-19 generally have mild, cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported in some children. Children with certain 
underlying medical conditions
, such as chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, serious heart conditions, or weak immune systems, might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Call your child's healthcare provider if you are worried about your child's health or if you child has symptoms of COVID-19. In case of emergency, call 911 or go to your local emergency department. Do NOT delay getting emergency care for your child because of COVID-19. 
Should I continue well visits and routine vaccine visits for my child during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Routine well child visits and vaccine visits are still important during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Newborn visits: Ideally, newborn visits should be done in-person so that your pediatric healthcare provider can check your baby's growth and feeding, check for jaundice, complete newborn screening tests, and get any repeat or follow-up testing, if necessary.
Well child visits: Your pediatric healthcare provider will check your child's development at well child visits.
Vaccine visits: Vaccines are an important part of keeping your child healthy, especially if your child is under 2 years old. Vaccines help provide immunity before being exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases such as measles, influenza (flu) and pertussis (whooping cough). This will help prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases among your children during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Ask your healthcare provider how they are taking steps to separate healthy patients from those who may be sick. Some healthcare providers may choose to delay visits like well child checks and routine vaccine visits.

I’m literally worried about this. How long do you anticipate this is going to last?












It depends on a lot of things. We hope to flatten the curve by social distancing. I don’t imagine we’re going to stop social distancing for at least a few months. We have really good tools here. Social distancing got them through a pandemic 100 years ago. It works. Handwashing works. I don’t want you to live in fear every day.












If a person gets the virus and recovers, can they get it a second time?












We don’t believe so. We don’t have any scientific articles that provide this data yet but we assume having the virus provides immunity but we can’t say for certain this is the case.

The CDC does not generally issue advisories or restrictions for travel within the United States. However, cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in many states, and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease. Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase chances of getting COVID-19, if there are other travelers with coronavirus infection. There are several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel.




















Things to Consider Before Travel




















Is COVID-19 spreading in the area where you’re going?












If COVID-19 is spreading in your destination, but not where you live, you may be more at risk of infection than if you stayed home. If you
have questions about your destination, check the local health department website in that area for more information.












Will you or your travel companion(s) be in close contact with others during your trip?












Your risk of exposure to respiratory viruses like coronavirus may increase in crowded settings, particularly closed-in settings with little air
circulation. This may include settings such as conferences, public events (like concerts and sporting events), religious gatherings, public
spaces (like movie theaters and shopping malls), and public transportation (like buses, metro, trains).












Are you or your travel companion(s) more likely to get severe illness if you get COVID-19?












People at high risk of severe disease are 
older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions
 (like heart and lung
disease or diabetes). CDC recommends 
travelers at high risk for COVID-19 complications
 avoid all cruise and nonessential air travel.












Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you are told to stay home for 14 days for self-monitoring or if you get sick with COVID-19?












If you have close contact with someone with COVID-19 during travel, you may be asked to stay home to self-monitor and avoid contact
with others for up to 14 days after travel. If you become sick with COVID-19, you may be unable to go to work or school until you’re considered noninfectious. You will be asked to avoid contact with others (including being in public places) during this period of infectiousness.












Do you live with someone who is older or has a serious, chronic medical condition?












If you get sick with COVID-19 upon your return from travel, your household contacts may be at risk of infection. Household contacts who
are 
older adults or persons of any age with severe chronic medical conditions
 are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.












Are there adequate Healthcare services in the area I am traveling to?












Health systems are designed to support populations that reside in that local area and may be taxed during peak travel seasons. Additional
patients may quickly overwhelm the health system in that area. Local healthcare providers will not have immediate access to your health
records, potentially delaying appropriate treatment and increasing your risk.














































































Travel Safely and Responsibly
If your unique circumstances still require you to travel, 
take steps
 to help prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 and other respiratory
diseases during travel and when you come home. For the most up-to-date COVID-19 travel information, visit

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Executive David Coulter released the following statement in response to the story about the 15-year-old girl placed by Oakland County Circuit Court at Children’s Village for a probation violation of not completing online schoolwork, among other reasons:
“I spoke with the Judge this evening. While there are many more details that she is unable to share with me and the public to protect privacy of the minor and their family, I believe a review of this case within her court or during an appellate process is required. It has been a top priority of my administration to keep the young people and employees safe at Children’s Village during the pandemic and that includes limiting residency to immediate safety risks.”

Oakland County, Michigan – County Executive David Coulter, along with Oakland County Board of Commissioners Chairman David T. Woodward (D-Royal Oak) and Oakland County Clerk/Register of Deeds Lisa Brown, announced today several steps the county is taking to ensure 2020 elections are safe and secure during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“These elections are sure to draw unprecedented interest, not only because of the candidates and issues involved, but because of the challenges COVID-19 presents for conducting an election that is safe and fair,” Coulter said. “That’s why this Oakland Together 2020 Democracy Initiative is so important. Our goal is to ensure safe, healthy, secure elections with full participation by Oakland County residents.”
Woodward formed the Oakland County Safe, Healthy, and Secure Election Advisory Council in June with Commissioner Nancy Quarles, local clerks and local democracy advocacy groups. Since its creation, the council has identified challenges and made recommendations to the Board of Commissioners to support local elections with safety measures during the pandemic. These measures aim to protect Oakland County voters and election workers while preserving the democratic process.
“Safe and secure elections are essential to our democracy,” Woodward said. “We are doing everything we can and using every resource necessary to help our local communities hold safe and secure election during this pandemic. The Oakland Together 2020 Democracy Initiative is the largest effort in Michigan of its kind.”
The council has focused on four key areas: easy and informed absentee voter participation, safe polling locations with full implementation of health protocols, trained new election workers and precautions for vulnerable workers, and adequate equipment to count ballots and promote confidence in elections.
“I am extremely proud of the work the council has done to help ensure Oakland County residents have the freedom and flexibility to vote in a way that makes them comfortable, while also protecting themselves and election workers, ” Commissioner Nancy Quarles (D-Southfield), chair of the advisory council, said.
The Board of Commissioners has adopted four resolutions to address these issues. They are:
MR#20172, which urged all Oakland County residents to vote by mail to avoid COVID-19 exposure at polling locations. This was adopted by the Board on June 25.
MR#20183, which created an interlocal agreement to facilitate local communities partnering with the county clerk to process and count absentee ballots. In accordance with PA 95 of 2020, Oakland County received requests for assistance from 20 local communities for the primary and 40 local communities for the general. This was adopted on June 4.
MR#20241, which appropriated $500,000 to communicate about the safety of absentee voting and provide clear instructions to voters on the primary ballot. This was adopted on July 2.
MR#20220, which appropriated funding for new voter tabulation equipment and purchasing a new virtual election worker training program so that all communities can train new workers remotely. This was adopted on July 2.
In addition, the advisory council has made two recommendations that will be considered by the Board at future meetings. They are:
Prepaid postage for November absentee ballots to remove an additional barrier for residents who choose to vote by mail.
A Protect Democracy Election Worker Recruitment and Retention Program, which support local clerks retain and recruit election workers during the pandemic by paying election works an additional $50.
“We see more spoiled ballots in the August primary elections than any other election,” Brown said. “We want to ensure every citizen’s vote counts, so we are reminding them to: Use a blue or black ink pen when filling in the box next to your choice; only vote for one party’s candidates otherwise you will spoil your ballot and the entire partisan section won’t count; also vote the non-partisan column, and check both sides of your ballot, voting the same party on both sides. When you return your absentee ballot, be sure to sign the outer envelope. It must be at your city or township clerk’s office by 8 p.m. election day.”
Joe Rozell, director of elections for Brown, served as vice chair of the Oakland County Safe, Healthy, and Secure Election Advisory Council. For more information about the Board of Commissioners, please visit

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County retail stores, restaurants and personal service businesses such as salons and fitness centers impacted by the coronavirus pandemic can apply beginning today for part of the $32 million Oakland Together Small Business Recovery Grant fund.
The grants – which range from $2,500-$10,000 – provide an infusion of capital to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses or other similar ones that occur in the ordinary course of business. The funds come from Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act money allocated to Oakland County by the federal government.
“We know that many of our small businesses have reopened but the losses they suffered while they were closed or operating at reduced capacity are significant and continue to threaten their viability,” Oakland County Executive David Coulter said. “We want to do all we can to help them recover and continue to provide the goods and services that are so important to our residents.”
In June, Coulter requested the county Board of Commissioners allocate $32 million to create the recovery grants. The board unanimously approved the request, with $30 million of the allocation earmarked for small businesses. Only businesses that operate a physical location in Oakland County are eligible to receive grant funds through this program.
Applications are accepted online at 
www.oakgov.com/covid/grants
, which also describes the program in detail and lists the type of eligible businesses, which include:
Retail trade
Food and lodging
Business and personal services
Entertainment and recreation
Construction and maintenance services
The deadline to apply is August 24. Award determinations will be made about every two weeks until the deadline.
The funds are intended to support for-profit businesses with 100 or fewer employees that suffered actual or anticipated losses from March 2020 through July 2020 due to the pandemic:
Experienced a loss of revenue
Operated at a reduced level of production, sales, employment or service
Fully closed all operations and are now in the process of reopening
Coulter and the board have been aggressive in funding programs and services to help mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic to businesses, communities and residents, devoting more than $100 million to the cause.
Allocations and services include:
Nearly $14 million to 3,500 small businesses seriously impacted by the pandemic. Grants averaged nearly $4,000 from the small business stabilization fund.
The “Saving Businesses, Saving Lives” grant, which incentivized Oakland County manufacturers to produce personal protective equipment for health care workers, hospitals and first responders, is included in the nearly $14 million fund.
$10 million fund to support non-profit organizations
$32 million to assist Oakland County communities with costs related to COVID-19
15,000 Oakland Together COVID-19 safety kits which include facemasks, no-touch thermometers, gloves and sanitizer were created to give small businesses essential materials for reopening and customers confidence they would have a safe experience. The kits are available to small businesses, faith-based and nonprofit organizations.
$32 million to help retail stores, restaurants and personal service businesses such as salons and fitness centers that were impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
$8.1 million for the Rent, Mortgage & Utility Relief Program to assist eligible county residents who have fallen behind on their rent, mortgage or utility payments because of a lost job or other income reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic with a one-time grant of up to $15,000 per household.

Pontiac, Michigan - Oakland County Executive David Coulter today presented his recommended operating budget for the next three years, which focuses on expanding health care for underserved people, embracing diversity and inclusion, protecting the natural environment and educational attainment as keys for the county’s growth and stability.
The budget was presented to the office of County Clerk Lisa Brown earlier today. It was based in part on the premise – made to the board during Coulter’s April budget message – that county expenditures should equal county revenues, and that continued fiscal discipline is vital to maintaining Oakland County’s enviable AAA bond rating – especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Coulter will present the budget request to the full Board of Commissioners on July 15.
“This budget illustrates that Oakland County is in a strong fiscal position to weather the current COVID-19 crisis as we have past fiscal crises, and to demonstrate the county’s continuing commitment to maintain a strong fiscal position for the future,” Coulter said.
“This is also the time for us to demonstrate our commitment to addressing the challenges we face as a county and to lean in as we did during the pandemic to lift all residents so they may participate in an equitable, fair and just county that celebrates diversity, creates opportunity and that ensures a bright future for our kids and grandkids. This is truly Oakland Together.”
Coulter said it was his administration’s intention to eliminate the practice of utilizing fund equity to balance the budget.
Key budget initiatives include:
Expanding and protecting health care for underserved populations
Embracing diversity, equity and inclusion
Protecting water and environment
Addressing climate change
Raising education attainment
For expanded health care, Coulter cited Oakland Health 360, a partnership with Honor Community Health, which brings primary care, dental care, family planning and behavioral heath into Oakland County Health Division clinics. A second partner is Oakland Livingston Human Service Agency, which will delivery insurance coverage, Head Start and emergency services such as energy, food and housing assistance.
Protecting the county’s water and environment, and effects of climate change, are priorities for Coulter’s administration. The county has 1,450 lakes, 138 miles of trails and 90,000 acres of parkland. Coulter said
“The threat of the overheating climate has real consequences for our lakes and rivers, infrastructure, agriculture and public health,” Coulter said. “What is most important to me is that we have an actionable plan with evaluation tools and measurements to accompany our goal. This budget devotes staff resources to a sustainability effort within our Planning Division. I look forward to working with the Board of Commissioners to conduct a comprehensive energy audit and an assessment of greenhouse gas emissions and sources across our county facilities and develop a plan to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 utilizing renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency.”
The budget noted Oakland County’s impact on the state’s economy, with the county’s 2018 gross domestic product of $112 billion representing 23 percent of the state’s total gross domestic product. An economic development 10-year strategic plan is proposed that focuses on the importance of local clusters (restaurants, retail, and personal services) and traded clusters (good producing companies, i.e. manufacturing) across the county and regional partnerships.
Coulter’s Oakland Together agenda holds at its core the values of diversity, equity and inclusion. The budget includes the position devoted to implementing the board’s resolution to make Oakland County a “welcoming county” for immigrants and refugees. Coulter plans in the coming months to engage county employees in cultural awareness, evaluate program delivery, and create hiring and contracting metrics upon which county efforts are evaluated and judged.
Coincidentally, the same day the budget was presented to the clerk, the county’s first Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, Robin Carter-Cooper started her employment with the county.


“It is the responsibility of government to serve all residents, level the playing field, remove obstacles and create opportunity for all,” Coulter said. “For me this starts by being honest about the systemic racism that exists, the disenfranchisement that too many of our residents’ experience, and the income inequality and wealth gap that is growing not narrowing.”
Working with education and workforce leaders last winter, Coulter formed his Oakland80 Task Force and proposed an ambitious goal of having 80 percent of Oakland County adults with a postsecondary degree or credential by 2030.
“I look forward to working with the Board of Commissioners and our Oakland80 Task Force on a college counseling corps that increases enrollment and retainment in postsecondary programs and a fund that provides a last dollar commitment to eligible adults to completing their associate degree or industry certificate,” Coulter said. “Our strong workforce division will also continue to provide new apprenticeship programs in high demand careers that deliver industry-recognized credentials.
The General Fund/General Purpose Estimated Revenue and Appropriations are balanced at $454,836,699 for Fiscal Year 2021; $468,435,078 for FY 2022; and $472,235,306 for FY 2023. The total budget for all funds amounts to $900,531,197 for FY 2021; $915,305,789 for FY 2022; and $921,033,952 for FY 2023.

Troy, Michigan — Automation Alley, Michigan’s Industry 4.0 knowledge center and the World Economic Forum’s Advanced Manufacturing Hub (AMHUB) for North America, is the recipient of a $10 million grant from Oakland County and $2 million grant from Macomb County to help each county’s manufacturing base purchase and implement Industry 4.0 technologies that can be used in direct support of manufacturing Personal Protection Equipment (PPE).
The COVID-19 pandemic is reshaping and accelerating the digital transformation of the manufacturing sector, and Industry 4.0 technologies are leading the way. Oakland County, in partnership with Macomb County and Automation Alley, has created the Personal Protective Equipment Resilience Grant Program to address the urgent need to move Oakland County and Macomb County-based companies quickly into the digital manufacturing age of Industry 4.0 to help improve our region’s manufacturing agility for PPE.
The announcement of the Personal Protective Equipment Resilience Grant Program was made at a press conference this afternoon at Automation Alley’s headquarters in Troy, where Oakland County Executive David Coulter, Macomb County Executive Mark A.

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County residents who have fallen behind on their rent, mortgage or utility payments because of a lost job or other income reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic may be eligible for a one-time grant of up to $15,000 per household.
County Executive David Coulter today introduced the Rent, Mortgage & Utility Relief Program for Citizens that will pay up to three months of past-due rent, housing or utility bills for low income Oakland County residents who have been unable to pay their bills because of an income hardship directly related to the pandemic.
“This pandemic has been devasting to our economy, our businesses and so many of our residents,” Coulter said. “This program will give some residents who have lost jobs or had their income severely reduced a chance to get back on their feet without having the added pressure of figuring out how to stay in their house, apartment or having their utilities shut off and still managing to keep their families – and themselves – safe.”
The county Board of Commissioners approved a $5 million allocation from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act last week to fund the program. An additional $3.1 million comes from the federal community development block grants.
Applications for the program can be found at 
www.oakgov.com/COVID
 and will be accepted beginning Wednesday through August 31. A second phase begins October 1 to November 30.
Residents of 53 Oakland County communities that participate in the county’s community development block grant program are eligible to apply. Residents of Farmington Hills, Royal Oak, Southfield and Waterford Township are not eligible as those communities receive funds directly from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Lake Angelus, Novi Township, Southfield Township and Bingham Farms do not participate in the block grant program.
A complete list detailing the eligibility requirements for the grants is found at 
www.oakgov.com/covid
. Applications can be picked up at Oakland County Community & Home Improvement, Oakland Pointe, Suite 1900, 250 Elizabeth Lake Road, Pontiac, Mich., 48341-0414 between 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.
Questions, applications and supporting documentation can be submitted by email to OCHousingRelief@oakgov.com. Residents can also request an application be mailed to them by calling 248-858-0730.
Coulter and the board have been aggressive in funding programs and services to help mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic to businesses, communities and residents, devoting nearly $100 million to the cause.
Allocations and services include:
Nearly $14 million was allocated to 3,500 small businesses seriously impacted by the pandemic. Grants averaged nearly $4,000 from the small business stabilization fund.
The “Saving Businesses, Saving Lives” grant, which incentivized Oakland County manufacturers to produce personal protective equipment for health care workers, hospitals and first responders, is included in the nearly $14 million fund.
$10 million fund to support non-profit organizations.
$35 million to assist Oakland County communities with costs related to COVID-19.
15,000 Oakland Together COVID-19 safety kits which include facemasks, no-touch thermometers, gloves and sanitizer were created to give small businesses essential materials for reopening and customers confidence they will have a safe experience. The kits are available to small businesses, faith-based and nonprofit organizations.
$32 million to help retail stores, restaurants and personal service businesses such as salons and fitness centers that were impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Three individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 reported being at Fifth Avenue Royal Oak the evening of June 19, prior to the start of symptoms.
The COVID-19 potential exposure was identified through case investigations conducted by the Oakland County Health Division. The individuals reported crowded conditions at the establishment, which describes itself as catering to sports and entertainment patrons. Fifth Avenue is located at 215 W. 5
th
 Ave. in Royal Oak.
"We are urging all of our businesses, especially the bars which are attracting crowds, to follow the governor's orders and take the necessary steps to protect their workers and customers," Oakland County Executive David Coulter said. "We have made good progress in managing what is a highly contagious virus and we can't backslide now. Social distancing and facial coverings work and they are critical to our safe re-opening strategies."
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone, anyone can get and spread COVID-19. Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community.
"The risk of COVID-19 exposure is heightened under crowded conditions, where social distancing cannot be achieved, said Leigh-Anne Stafford, health officer at Oakland County Health Division.  "Restaurants, bars and nightclubs have been allowed to open with requirements to reduce their capacity to 50 percent of normal seating so that social distancing can be achieved."
If you were at Fifth Avenue Royal Oak on the evening of June 19, you should monitor for signs and symptoms. People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Call your physician or the Health Division if you think you are developing any of the symptoms of COVID-19 described below.

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Muscle or body aches

Pontiac, Michigan – Eighty-four non-profit organizations whose services were severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis will share $9.7 million in grants from the Oakland Together Community Response and Recovery Fund, Oakland County Executive David Coulter said today.
The grants, which ranged from $4,000 to $500,000, will help the organizations restore vital services and programs for Oakland County residents such as food distribution, shelter, health care and financial assistance that were reduced or eliminated because of the pandemic. The program was administered in partnership with United Way for Southeastern Michigan.
“This geographically diverse collection of grants will go directly to front-line organizations that provide essential services and programming for nearly 500,000 Oakland County residents, especially during this unprecedented time,” Coulter said. “I’m grateful to the United Way for Southeastern Michigan for doing the administrative ‘heavy lifting’ to move this program along quickly and efficiently and the county Board of Commissioners for funding the program.”
Grant recipients include Jewish Family Service of Metropolitan Detroit, Forgotten Harvest; Easterseals Michigan, Community Housing Network, Pontiac Community Foundation, Arab American and Chaldean Council, Gleaners Community Food Bank, Lighthouse of Michigan, Centro Multicultural La Familia, Micah 6 Community, Oakland Family Services and Grace Centers of Hope. The complete list of grant recipients is found at 
www.oakgov.com/covid/grants
.
Coulter praised the oversite panel of county Commissioners Adam Kochenderfer, Angela Powell and Helaine Zack, who reviewed and approved the grant applications and recommendations.
“A program of this size and scope does not happen without support from many people,” Coulter said. “I appreciate the fine work of Commissioners Kochenderfer, Powell and Zack, who whose commitment will help countless Oakland County residents.”
Zack said the results from the partnership exceeded her expectations.
"Combined, the diverse representation of non-profits that will receive these grants service the entire geographic footprint of Oakland County,” Zack said. “I am proud of how quickly we were able to award funding so that these organizations may continue supporting our residents."
Grant applicants had to be based in Oakland County or provide services to county residents and be a 501(c)(3) organization. Grants were to be used for costs incurred by Dec. 30, 2020 and ensure operational continuity and expansion to meet growing demand for support services in the county.
The grants will support community non-profits that have been negatively impacted by the shutdown and need assistance re-opening safely under new protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state and the Oakland County Health Division. Highest priority was placed on organizations that support the basic needs of county residents, including food, housing, health care (including both physical and behavioral) or financial assistance.
Grants were awarded according to three funding tiers:
Operational Grants up to $50,000 for direct COVID-19 related expenses and to maintain existing operations during the pandemic.
Enhanced Operating Grants up to $100,000 for COVID-19 related expenses, those to comply with health orders and new protocols and seek funds to maintain and expand operations to meet growing demand.
Community Service Grants up to $500,000 to provide service to vulnerable populations and to combat secondary effects of the pandemic. The organization must have an annual operating budget of at least $5 million, reach clients throughout Oakland County, provide services to an expanded population and can demonstrate the ability to deploy the larger amount of funds requested within the spending period.
Funding priorities included:
Organizations on the frontlines of emergency assistance during the pandemic.
• Organizations that address critical needs or serve a vulnerable population.
Organizations providing economic support to individuals or families suffering from employment or business interruptions due to coronavirus-related business closures.
Direct assistance may include utilities, prescriptions, rent, virtual learning, understanding public health orders and safety protocols, financial counseling.
Organizations that have a long-standing track record in the community.
Organizations that have not received federal, state, county, foundation or philanthropic support sufficient to continue providing service in the community. There should be no duplicative funding for the same services provided.
The Community Response Recovery Fund is the latest initiative from Coulter and the board to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus on the economy, businesses, non-profits, communities, veterans and county residents. The funds are part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act allocation to the county from the federal government.
Coulter and the board have been aggressive in funding programs and services to help mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic to businesses, communities and veterans, devoting nearly $61 million to the cause and another $32 million awaits board approval.
The county also created and is distributing 10,000 “Oakland Together” COVID-19 safety kits which include facemasks, no-touch thermometers, gloves and sanitizer to give small businesses, faith-based and nonprofit organizations essential materials for reopening and customers confidence they will have a safe experience. The Department of Economic Development & Community Affairs produced another 5,000 kits because of the popularity of the kits.

A recent national survey of human resource leaders by Gartner, Inc. found 86 percent of organizations are using virtual technology to interview candidates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The free workshops are held Tuesdays from 10-11 a.m. through August 25. Registration is available at

“Interviewing for a job can stressful enough on its own and now applicants have to contend with technology while figuring out the best way to present themselves virtually,” Oakland County Executive David Coulter said. “We want to make sure we’re doing all we can to prepare residents for this new reality.”
Oakland County Michigan Works! Director Jennifer Llewellyn said the format and questions being asked in either type of interview may be similar. She advises candidates to:
Prepare responses to expected questions
Test your computer in advance to make sure the built-in camera and microphone work and the internet connection is strong
Test the angle of the camera to ensure your face and body are positioned properly
Check the lighting in the area
Decluttering the area where the virtual interview is going to take place
“We want to put job seekers in the best position possible to land their next job,” Llewellyn said. “That means making a great impression, whether in-person or on a virtual basis. We expect this workshop on virtual interviews to be very popular over the next couple of months.”
Since its launch in May, the Virtual Workshop Program has attracted nearly 500 participants from around southeast Michigan. Other topics include resume writing, LinkedIn best practices, gig jobs – non-traditional employment opportunities, mid-life career transitions, and unemployment and budgeting. Oakland County Michigan Works! has expanded the schedule of workshops to run through August.
The complete schedule can be found at the website referenced above.
Oakland County Michigan Works! operates service centers in Novi, Oak Park, Pontiac, Southfield, Troy, and Waterford.

At a time when some of them have been adversely affected by the coronavirus and could use some assistance, it is our responsibility to support them where we can.”

Legible copy of DD-214, separation report, or military service letter belonging to the applicant or the veteran to whom the application is related.
Proof of Oakland County residence. If the applicant resides in a shelter or transitional housing, the applicant must provide a ‘Shelter Verification’ to establish residency.

Birth certificate of minor children
Marriage license
Adoption documentation
Death certificate of veteran


Proof of household income/expenses, including income from all household members 18 years of age and older.

Questions about the program should contact Oakland County Veterans’ Services at 248-858-0785 or veterans-services@oakgov.com.

Allocations and services include:
Nearly $14 million was allocated to 3,500 small businesses seriously impacted by the pandemic. Grants averaged nearly $4,000 from the small business stabilization fund.
The “Saving Businesses, Saving Lives” grant, which incentivized Oakland County manufacturers to produce personal protective equipment for health care workers, hospitals and first responders, is included in the nearly $14 million fund.

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Executive David Coulter and two health care systems are partnering with faith-based communities in Pontiac and Southfield to offer free drive-thru COVID-19 testing at 14 locations beginning next week.
Coulter said that testing will involve 15 churches in Pontiac and Southfield and be conducted by McLaren Oakland in Pontiac and Ascension Providence Hospital-Southfield Campus in partnership with the Oakland County Health Division. The testing will be offered at 14 locations representing the churches in Pontiac and Southfield. Two of the churches offer testing at one location.
“The impact of COVID-19 on our communities of color has shined a bright light on long-standing racial disparities in access to health care,” Coulter said. “It is unacceptable, and we are responding by taking testing directly to at-risk individuals which will give us the ability to track and mitigate a re-emergence of the virus.”
The testing partnership, which is supported by the Oakland County Board of Commissioners and Commissioners Janet Jackson, Angela Powell and Nancy Quarles, provides free drive-thru testing at the locations beginning Monday through July 2. Preregistration is required at 
www.oakgov.com/covid/testing
. Results are expected in 48-72 hours.
“I am grateful for the leadership of these pastors who are helping us get the word out about the importance of testing,” Coulter said. “It is vital that health care is available and accessible to all residents throughout Oakland County. I am grateful to Ascension and McLaren for their support.”
The county has been transparent with data from early in the pandemic, releasing cases by zip code and by demographic. When the race of over 50 percent of cases was unknown the Health Division set up a task force of staff to go back and collect that data. It revealed that African- Americans were disproportionally impacted by the virus representing 33 percent of the COVID-19 cases and 36.2 percent of the fatalities. This information is available on the county dashboard at 
https://www.oakgov.com/covid/dashboard.html
.
The Health Division and Honor Community Health offer drive-thru testing at the Oakland County Complex, 1200 N. Telegraph Road in Pontiac. Testing is Tuesday and Thursday from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Results are expected in 24-48 hours. Testing is also available at the Health Division’s Southfield office at 27725 Greenfield Road on Monday and Wednesday from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Testing is available on Friday’s in the parking lot of the Novi Civic Center, 45175 W. 10 Mile Road in Novi.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Executive David Coulter today said he will seek $32 million to help retail stores, restaurants and personal service businesses such as salons and fitness centers that were impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
Coulter will ask the county Board of Commissioners for a $32 million allocation to create Oakland Together Economic Recovery Grants. They would provide an immediate infusion of capital to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses or other similar ones that occur in the ordinary course of business. The funds would come from CARES Act money allocated by the federal government.
“This small business community is a key driver to having a successful economy in Oakland County,” Coulter said. “As our small businesses reopen, we want to ensure they have the resources to keep their customers safe and recover from the downturn.
“These businesses are the fabric of our communities, providing job opportunities for our neighbors and life experiences that make our communities desirable.”
The board is expected to consider the request next week. If approved, the program would begin July 1. Online applications will be accepted then and the deadline for submission is August 25. They will be reviewed as they are received, and a funding decision would be made.
“It’s important as we consider the applications that we remember the areas of the county hardest hit by the pandemic,” Coulter said.
Coulter and the board have been aggressive in funding programs and services to help mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic to businesses and communities, devoting nearly $60 million to the cause.
Allocations and services include:
Nearly $14 million was allocated to 3,500 small businesses seriously impacted by the pandemic. Grants averaged nearly $4,000 from the small business stabilization fund.
The “Saving Businesses, Saving Lives” grant, which incentivized Oakland County manufacturers to produce personal protective equipment for health care workers, hospitals and first responders, is included in the nearly $14 million fund.
$10 million fund to support non-profit organizations.
$35 million to assist Oakland County communities with costs related to COVID-19.
15,000 Oakland Together COVID-19 safety kits which include facemasks, no-touch thermometers, gloves and sanitizer were created to give small businesses essential materials for reopening and customers confidence they will have a safe experience. The kits are available to small businesses, faith-based and nonprofit organizations.
If approved by the board, the Recovery Grant Fund would bring the total pandemic allocation to nearly $93 million. The funds are intended to support for-profit businesses that due to the COVID – 19 pandemic, suffered actual or anticipated losses from March 2020 through July 2020:
Experienced a loss of revenue
Operated at a reduced level of production, sales, employment or service
Fully closed all operations and are now in the process of reopening
Only businesses that operate a physical location in Oakland County are eligible to apply for and receive grant funds through this program. Eligible businesses for a Recovery Grant Fund include:
Retail trade
Accommodations and food service
Business and personal services
Entertainment and recreation
Household maintenance and repair
“Small businesses are the hiring engine of our county,” Coulter said. “When we talk about assistance and helping everyday folks who are experiencing hardships from COVID-19, it does not get any more direct than helping the small businesses that employ a great majority of our Oakland County residents.”
Oakland County has:
Nearly 4,500 retail establishments with less than 50 employees and about 300 with 50 or more employees. Collectively, they employee more than 73,800 people.
Establishments that serve alcohol but no food: 100
Restaurants/bars that serve food: 2,263
Health/personal care stores: 649
Varies building contractors with less than 50 employees: 2,500

​Pontiac, Michigan – The Oakland County Health Division and Oakland Schools are collaborating on a $2 million COVID-19 school nurse initiative which aims to give students, parents, school faculty and staff confidence that they will be safe when school resumes in the fall.
The 
Oakland Together School Nurse Initiative
 will assist schools with public health strategies and direction to prevent the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus. School nurses will provide communication, training, consultation and recommendations to school districts when students return for classes in the fall. The Health Division plans to hire 68 nurses to work with schools through December, Oakland County Executive David Coulter said today.
“We know the concern the virus has caused among students, parents, school faculty and staff,” Coulter said. “We are working closely with our partners at Oakland Schools to provide prevention strategies that will allow our schools to resume the important work of educating our young people. We want everyone to have confidence we are doing everything we can to provide a safe and healthy learning environment.”
Dr. Wanda Cook-Robinson, superintendent of Oakland Schools, said the partnership comes at an important time for education and families.
“After the child's home, school represents the second most influential environment in a child's life,“ Cook-Robinson said. “We are excited to be partnering with the Oakland County Health Division to bring the Oakland Together School Nurse Initiative to our students, parents, teachers and staff. Nurses working in the schools will have a crucial role in supporting health services to children and youth during this pandemic as they will be instrumental in implementing practices that will help prevent the spread of COVID-19.”
The county Board of Commissioners is expected to consider the request when it meets in two weeks. Funding would come from the federal CARES Act. The program is believed to be the first of its kind in the state.
The program has three components, which include communication, training, consultation and
recommendations. Nurses would meet with individual districts to update them on COVID-19 activity in the community, provide prevention strategies for high-risk children and connect parents to additional resourced as 
Students would be instructed on social distancing strategies, hand washing, health screening and
planning for what may come next in the pandemic. Other focus areas include:
Assist school districts in creating and implementing health screening protocols
Assist schools to identify and create sick/isolation rooms
Create educational messages on the importance of prevention and staying home when sick
Provide access to COVID-19 resources for students, parents, teachers and staff
The school nurse initiative is the latest in a series of moves Coulter, with support from the board, has undertaken to support business, non-profits and local communities during the pandemic.
Coulter moved aggressively to help struggling small businesses through the allocation of nearly $14 million to 3,500 small businesses seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Grants averaged nearly $4,000 from the small business stabilization fund. The “Saving Businesses,
Saving Lives” grant is included in the nearly $14 million fund.
The county recently began distributing 10,000 “Oakland Together” COVID-19 safety kits which include facemasks, no-touch thermometers, gloves and sanitizer to give small businesses essential materials for reopening and customers confidence they will have a safe experience. The toolkits were available to small businesses, faith-based and nonprofit organizations. The popularity of the kits has prompted the county to prepare another 5,000 kits for distribution.
Oakland County set aside $30 million from their allocation of CARES Act funds for cities, townships, and villages impacted by COVID-19.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County has added 
a new map
 to its 
COVID-19 data dashboard
 to enhance the public's understanding of coronavirus activity by zip code. It shows recent cases confirmed within the past 30 days. 
"We've launched a new source of information to give our residents a more real time view of the virus in their community," County Executive David Coulter said. "Transparency and reliance on science and health is key to all phases of combatting a novel virus.  As I said when we first released a zip code map, the virus does not respect community boundaries so everyone, everywhere must continue to follow safety protocols.  As we reopen safely what slowed COVID-19 now keeps us safe: facial coverings, social distancing and testing."
The public will be able to view the number of recent coronavirus cases by zip code and compare them to the overall total cases map. Both maps are updated daily. The total cases map will continue to provide an overall picture of how zip codes in the county have been impacted by COVID-19 from the beginning of the pandemic.
Adjustments were also made to our dashboard data to more accurately reflect the date a case is initially referred to Oakland County Health Division. This will eliminate potential lag times between laboratory reporting and information transfers to the state reporting system. This correction 
does not change the total number of cases or deaths to date
 in Oakland County and will better reflect the date of diagnosis instead of the date the result was reported in the state reporting system.

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Executive David Coulter today unveiled a $10 million Oakland Together Community Response and Recovery Fund to help non-profit organizations resume services that were severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.
The fund will make grants from up to $50,000 and up to $500,000 available to non-profits that provide vital services such as food, shelter, health care and financial assistance to Oakland County residents. It will be administered by United Way for Southeastern Michigan. Grant applications are accepted today until June 16 at 
https://unitedwaysem.org/OaklandTogether
.
“We are keenly aware the widespread impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our communities, our businesses and the non-profit organizations that provide a lifeline of critical support and services to our residents,” Coulter said. “The need is profound and immediate and will only grow in scope and severity. I’m grateful to the United Way for Southeastern Michigan and its president and CEO, Dr. Darienne Hudson, for partnering with us to get this program moving quickly and efficiently.”
Hudson said the United Way for Southeastern Michigan, which has a long and rich history of serving the needs of the community, is proud to partner with the county to ensure the grants are spent as effectively as possible to help people in need.
"We are grateful for the leadership of Executive Coulter, Chairman (David) Woodward, and the county board of commissioners throughout this crisis,” Hudson said. “We look forward to working together to ensure families have the support and resources necessary to weather this challenging time."
The Community Response Recovery Fund is the latest initiative from Coulter and the board to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus on the economy and county residents.
Coulter has aggressively supported small businesses through the allocation of nearly $14 million to 3,500 small businesses seriously impacted by the pandemic through the county’s small business stabilization grant, which includes the “Saving Businesses, Saving Lives” grants. The average grant award was nearly $4,000.
The county also created and is distributing 10,000 “Oakland Together” COVID-19 safety toolkits which include facemasks, no-touch thermometers, gloves and sanitizer to give small businesses, faith-based and nonprofit organizations essential materials for reopening and customers confidence they will have a safe experience.
Applicants for the Community Response and Recovery Fund must be based in Oakland County or provide services to county residents and be a 501(c)(3) organization. Grants must be used for costs incurred by December 30, 2020 and ensure operational continuity and expansion to meet growing demand for support services throughout the county.
The grants will support community non-profits that have been negatively impacted by the shutdown and need assistance re-opening safely under new protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state and the Oakland County Health Division. Highest priority will be placed on organizations that support the basic needs of county residents. The needs may include food, housing, health care (including both physical and behavioral) or financial assistance.
There are three funding tiers:
Operational Grants up to $50,000 for direct COVID-19 related expenses and to maintain existing operations during the pandemic.
Enhanced Operating Grants up to $100,000 for COVID-19 related expenses, those to comply with health orders and new protocols and seek funds to maintain and expand operations to meet growing demand.
Community Service Grants up to $500,000 to provide service to vulnerable populations and to combat secondary effects of the pandemic. The organization must have an annual operating budget of at least $5 million, reach clients throughout Oakland County, provide services to an expanded population and can demonstrate the ability to deploy the larger amount of funds requested within the spending period.
Funding priorities include:
Organizations on the frontlines of emergency assistance during the pandemic.
Organizations that address critical needs or serve a vulnerable population.
Organizations providing economic support to individuals or families suffering from employment or business interruptions due to coronavirus-related business closures.
Direct assistance may include utilities, prescriptions, rent, virtual learning, understanding public health orders and safety protocols, financial counseling.
Organizations that have a long-standing track record in the community.
Organizations that have not received federal, state, county, foundation or philanthropic support sufficient to continue providing service in the community. There should be no duplicative funding for the same services provided.
A live seminar will be held from 1-2 p.m. on June 12 to answer questions about the program. You can access the seminar at 
https://unitedwaysem.org/OaklandTogether
.
Questions also may be submitted to: OaklandCOVIDFund@UnitedWaySEM.org.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Effective Friday, June 5, Oakland County Health Division is rescinding Emergency Health Order 2020-8, which closed all indoor and outdoor playground equipment for children. Indoor playgrounds remain closed under State of Michigan Executive Order 2020-110 and social distancing is still required at outdoor parks and recreational facilities.
The County Health division is providing a day of preparation and recommends that playground operators utilize signage and other methods to remind visitors of the COVID-19 Health protocols which include practicing social distancing (six feet apart), wearing a face covering, covering for coughs and sneezes, and frequent handwashing. 
Follow these actions when visiting a park, beach, or recreational facility:
Stay at least six feet from others at all times. This can make some open areas, trails, and paths safer to use. Do not enter a crowded area.
Minimize gathering with others outside of your household.
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Keep hand sanitizer with you (at least 60% alcohol) for times when soap and water are not available.
Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e.g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e.g., mulch, sand) is not recommended.
Specifically, the language of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's order, which is now in effect, reads: 
"Unless otherwise prohibited by local regulation, outdoor parks and recreational facilities may be open, provided that they make any reasonable modifications necessary to enable employees and patrons not part of the same household to maintain six feet of distance from one another, and provided that areas in which social distancing cannot be maintained be closed, subject to guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.
"Subject to the exceptions in section 14, the following places are closed to ingress, egress, use, and occupancy by members of the public:
"Indoor services or facilities, or outdoor services or facilities involving close contact of persons, for amusement or other recreational or entertainment purposes, such as amusement parks, arcades, bingo halls, bowling alleys, indoor climbing facilities, indoor dance areas, skating rinks, trampoline parks, and other similar recreational or entertainment facilities."

​
Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Executive David Coulter today named Robin Carter-Cooper, currently executive director of instructional equity for the Rochester Community Schools, as the county’s first chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer.
Carter-Cooper, a Flint native and Genesee County resident, begins her position with Oakland County on July 1 and will report directly to Coulter.
“The diversity of Oakland County continues to be one of its strengths and Robin brings with her extensive experience in facilitation and training on social justice topics as well as being a leader in strategic planning in diversity, equity and inclusion,” Coulter said. “She will be a tremendous asset to Oakland County. I’m excited to have her as an integral part of my senior leadership team.”
Carter-Cooper, 36, said she looks forward to the challenges the position requires.
"I am honored to be the first chief diversity, equity and Inclusion officer for Oakland County,” Carter-Cooper said. “I am pleased at the commitment and priority that the Coulter administration has placed on this work and I am humbled to work beside such a courageous and forward-thinking team. I look forward to partnering with community members, working closely with staff, and building capacity around this work throughout the county."
Coulter and the Board of Commissioners collaborated to create the position earlier this year. Coulter said more than 30 percent of Oakland County’s population is ethnically diverse and it is important county policies ensure its workforce reflects the county’s diversity and that county government is an active community partner in promoting diversity initiatives.
Carter-Cooper’s responsibilities will include:
Cultivating a welcoming, diverse, and inclusive culture throughout the county’s internal and external community
Establishing a process to achieve accountability and coordination of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to drive positive change in all aspects of the county
Create an expansive and far reaching vision for diversity, equity and inclusion in Oakland County
Foster an environment of diversity, equity and inclusion that promotes open communication and collaboration across Oakland County communities, businesses and other organizations
Foster an environment that is highly focused on engaging county employees, community leaders, residents and business in diversity, equity and inclusion
Create a long-term diversity, equity and inclusion infrastructure needs internally and externally
In Rochester, Carter-Cooper had a host of diversity and instructional equity responsibilities with school administration, teachers, staff and the Board of Education, including as executive director of diversity, equity and inclusion. She began with Rochester in 2017.
Formerly, she was medical careers foundations teacher and work-based learning coordinator for Genesee Early College in Flint. She also was employed by the University of Michigan-Flint in the School of Health Professions and Studies as a program director and lecturer.
She has developed and facilitated workshops for teachers, administrators, counselors and support staff on various topics including:
How to Create Culturally Competent Communities
Systemic Racism and its Impact on Student Learning
Culturally Responsive Teaching and Curriculum Design for Equity
Cultural Competence in Health Care and Medical Mistrust
Carter-Cooper received her undergraduate degree from Georgia State University, graduate degree from Central Michigan University and her education specialist from Oakland University.
She was honored in 2019 by Crain’s Detroit Business as a member of its “Most Notable Women in Education Leadership.”

​Pontiac, Michigan – “Saving Business, Saving Lives” grant applications are now available to Oakland County-based manufacturers who can provide materials or services needed by small businesses to safely re-open from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The grant applications are accepted beginning today for manufacturers or companies who can help play a role in the re-boot for thousands of Oakland County small businesses either through the manufacture of essential items such as sanitizers, protective equipment and barriers or touchless technologies, County Executive David Coulter said. The fund has more than $300,000 to distribute.
“As many of our small businesses prepare to re-engage with customers, they will find a vastly different environment than the one they knew several months ago,” Coulter said. “Customers and employees alike are concerned with their health and safety and want businesses to take the necessary steps to keep them protected as they regain their confidence. These grants will provide vital goods and services to our small businesses to help reassure customers their health and safety is a priority.”
Coulter, with support from the Board of Commissioners, has aggressively supported small businesses through the allocation of nearly $14 million to 3,500 small businesses seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Grants averaged nearly $4,000 from the small business stabilization fund. The “Saving Businesses, Saving Lives” grant is included in the nearly $14 million fund.
The county last week began distributing 10,000 “Oakland Together” COVID-19 safety toolkits which include facemasks, no-touch thermometers, gloves and sanitizer to give small businesses essential materials for reopening and customers confidence they will have a safe experience. The toolkits were available to small businesses, faith-based and nonprofit organizations.
With Oakland County and Michigan moving into Phase 4, this round of grants expands the search to companies that can play a role in helping Oakland County businesses reopen by providing unique processes, products and services that will help Oakland County’s small businesses reopen.
The “Saving Business, Saving Lives” grants extend the health and safety theme. Previous funding rounds were successful in helping companies produce personal protective equipment such as face shields and masks for first responders and health care workers. Nearly $520,000 was awarded to 13 companies.
The new grants also coordinate seamlessly with Phase 4 of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s MI Safe Start for reopening the state’s economy as coronavirus cases continue to decline in Oakland County and the state.
“With Oakland County and Michigan moving into Phase 4, this round of grants expands the search to companies that can play a role in helping Oakland County businesses reopen by providing unique processes, products and services that will help Oakland County’s small businesses reopen,” Coulter said. “We are incentivizing businesses to help other businesses successfully reopen during this pandemic.”
Eligible products, processes or services include:
Barriers and partitions
Sanitizing services
Disinfectant and hand sanitizer
Fogging disinfectant systems for large areas
Signage
Portable stations (sanitizing and hand washing)
Gloves
Diagnostic tests or test kits for SARS-CoV-2
Temperature testing equipment
“Touchless” technologies
Social distancing products
Companies must be based in Oakland County. Preference will be given to companies that manufacture or produce in Oakland County and Michigan. Companies should have the capability to produce a significant volume of the product or service within 30-90 days.
Eligible use of funds includes:
Procuring necessary equipment to manufacture supplies
Logistics, shipping, technology upgrades
Other costs related to operationalizing new product lines.
Interested companies can apply for a grant at 
https://forms.oakgov.com/146
. The deadline is June 15 at 12 a.m. For questions: PPEgrant@oakgov.com.
Each grant application will be reviewed by a panel. The panel members are:
Manager Alain Piette, MI-SBTDC Technology Team
Dr. Carmine Jabri, co-founder of E.M.M.A. International Consulting Group, Inc.
Jaideep Rajput, director of commercialization for Beaumont Health Services
Michael W. Long, Ph.D., executive director of Oakland University Mobilization Zone
Julie Killian, CPA, Clayton & McKervey
Dan Radomski, director, Lawrence Technological University Centrepolis Accelerator

WAYNE COUNTY – the City of Detroit Health Department, Wayne County Public Health Division, Oakland County Health Division and Macomb County Health Department each issued Public Health Orders requiring all swimming pools licensed by each jurisdiction to remain closed indefinitely. 
These orders are issued under the Michigan Public Health Code to safeguard Southeast Michigan residents from potential transmission of COVID-19. Pool operators will be required to continue scheduled maintenance in accordance with the Michigan Administrative Rule. 
With temperatures rising, swimming pools have potential to attract large groups. As regional leaders, we are committed to doing the right thing, and closing pools is the right thing to do to protect the health and safety of residents and prevent the spread of the virus. 
This effort is also intended to help reduce the potential of a summer spike in new COVID-19 cases that could prevent schools from opening in the fall. 
Although pool water poses a low risk of transmitting COVID-19, it is difficult to maintain social distance in and around pools, as well as in the associated facilities- enclosures, deck areas and sanitary facilities. 
Licensed pools include those in apartments, condominiums, and hotels. Other recreational pools include, but are not limited to dive pools, wave pools, and water slide pools. Therapy pools used strictly for treatment in healthcare settings are excluded from this closure. 
Upon re-opening, pool operators must contact their respective Public Health Authority for an opening inspection to ensure the health and safety of residents, including the required water sample analysis. 
Public health agencies continue to encourage residents to do their part to protect themselves and others by practicing social distancing and following basic prevention steps:
Wash hands with soap & water frequently; use hand sanitizer when soap & water are not available
Cover your mouth and nose with your inner elbow when you cough of sneeze
Wear a mask while out in public areas
Stay home if you are feeling sick

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County will distribute 10,000 COVID-19 safety toolkits which include facemasks, no-touch thermometers, gloves and sanitizer to give small businesses essential materials for reopening and customers confidence they will have a safe experience.
Oakland County Executive David Coulter today said the self-contained “Oakland Together” plastic totes will be taken to 50 locations throughout the county for distribution by downtown development authorities, city managers, economic development officials and chambers of commerce. 
“The kits serve two purposes,” Coulter said. “We want to give our small businesses essential materials that have been difficult to acquire and are necessary when the OK comes for businesses to reopen safely. At the same time, we want customers to feel confident that our businesses are doing all they can to keep their customers and their employees safe. This is a priority for everyone.”
The kits are designed for small businesses with 50 employees or less that operate in Main Street Oakland County communities, other businesses not in a downtown, or faith-based organizations, among others. Kits have materials, based on the number of employees in a business. Besides masks and gloves, they include sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, floor stickers for interior spacing of customers or employees, posters and ideas for social distancing.
Materials were acquired from Oakland County-based companies when possible, including Detroit Sewn. The Pontiac-based company, which was making knitwear before the COVID-19 pandemic, received a $25,000 grant from the county to manufacture personal protective equipment for health care systems and first responders. The county purchased 150,000 masks from the company.
The county, at Coulter’s request and through funding approved by the Board of Commissioners, has provided $14 million in grant support for Oakland County small businesses. More than 3,500 small businesses seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will receive grants averaging nearly $4,000 from Oakland County’s small business stabilization fund.
The kits have more than $400 worth of supplies. They were assembled and stored in a warehouse space in Bloomfield Township provided by Oakland County businessman Roger Penske.
Among other items, the county purchased:
10,000 flap-top totes
30,000 bottles of hand sanitizer
10,000 touch-free thermometers
60,000 social distancing floor decals
10,000 ReOpen Resource Guide
10,000 “We care about your safety” poster 
500,000 Community Resource Guide
Distribution to the 50 locations begins on Thursday and should be completed by early next week and will be prioritized by business sector. In order of distribution:
Restaurants, bars, cafes, entertainment venues
Personal services, including salons, barbers and massage therapy
Retail
Professional services, including attorneys, insurance agents and realtors
The Department of Economic Development & Community Affairs estimated there are about 3,300 small businesses in the 25 Main Street Oakland County communities, more than 1,800 in downtowns not in the Main Street program and about 4,300 small businesses in other locations not covered by Main Street or a downtown development authority.

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County, McLaren Oakland hospital and the Pontiac Housing Commission will go on the road to offer free COVID-19 tests and other health services to residents of Carriage Circle Apartments beginning June 2.
The county, McLaren Oakland and the housing commission will be offering a host of services to Carriage Circle residents at the Pontiac apartment complex near Auburn Avenue and South Opdyke. Services include free COVID-19 tests, health screenings, food security assessments and evaluations to determine if there are other needs. County staff will be onsite help residents fill out the U.S. Census 2020 questionnaire.
“This COVID initiative builds on our Oakland Health360 initiative that will transform health services provided in our public health clinics,” Oakland County Executive David Coulter said. “COVID-19 highlights the racial disparities in our health care that were already unacceptable before the pandemic. It is important to take these critical health services where they are needed and I’m grateful to our partners for their willingness to help.”
McLaren will provide the nurses and other staff to do assessments of each person. The county’s Health Division will supply the testing kits. An appointment is required for a test. No appointment will be taken onsite.
“To protect those populations who are most at-risk for the coronavirus, and to help stop the virus’s spread, testing is essential,” said Margaret Dimond, Ph.D., McLaren Oakland president and chief executive officer. “We’re thankful to be in the position to help this population and continue to promote and support the health and wellbeing of our Pontiac community.”
Oakland County Commissioner Angela Powell, who represents Pontiac, worked closely with the county to help set up a place-based health clinic at the apartment complex.
“The numbers, according to the Oakland County Health Division, show that African Americans comprise more than 30 percent of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 36 percent of the deaths but only 14 percent of the population,” Powell said. “It is critical we bring testing to Pontiac residents where they live and who, for whatever reason, may have had limited access to testing. I applaud the county, McLaren Oakland and the Pontiac Housing Commission for stepping up and addressing this critical need.”
Carriage Circle also is being considered to receive a $39 million federally backed allocation from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under the HOME Investments Partnership Program to renovate the complex’s 200-plus housing units. The county has allocated $1.5 million to the project and the city of Pontiac has committed $500,000 to support the funding, should it be awarded.
The renovations would begin in 2021, Deputy County Executive Rudy Hobbs said.
Ahmad Taylor, executive director of the Pontiac Housing Commission, said the testing and planned renovations were great news for complex residents.
“This is a reinvention of the area,” Taylor said. “The residents want to see it happen. It’s all about action.”
Coulter and Taylor both thanked Powell for her role in getting the place-based testing in Pontiac and the funding for renovations.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Executive David Coulter and the county Board of Commissioners today announced $1 million in emergency grant assistance has been allocated for veterans, service members and eligible family members affected by the coronavirus.
The grants can be used for health, economic and financial hardships resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is comprised of $250,000 in COVID-19 emergency assistance awarded by the state and $750,000 from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
“The economic and personal hardships caused by Covid-19 have impacted veterans across Oakland County,” County Executive David Coulter said. “These grants are a welcome help to assist our veterans. I applaud the board for recognizing the great needs of our veterans during this unprecedented time and approving this resolution unanimously.”
The board approved the use of grant funds at its May 20 meeting. County Commissioner Penny Luebs of Clawson sponsored the resolution.
“Our veterans, service members and eligible family members with emergent health, economic and financial difficulties need our help,” Luebs said. “Mobile testing and reopening kits for American Legion and VFW locations, personal protection equipment kits for veterans and grant programs to help with mortgage, rent and utilities are just a few ways these funds can make an impact.
“I am proud to say that my father served in the Navy, one son served in the Army and another son is presently in the Army. We must do what we can for those who have contributed so much.”
Grants will be based on need and available to veterans, service members and eligible dependents living in Oakland County. Full eligibility and an online application are being developed and will be released soon.
"This pandemic hits communities differently, and it is vital that we recognize the impact the crisis is having on our veterans," Board Chairman David Woodward said. "The board stands with County Executive David Coulter in creating this relief fund to ensure that we're fighting for the men and women who have and currently defend us and our country.
Other uses of the CARE Act for veterans nationwide include increased funding for the Veterans Administration to hire more staff, fight against veteran homelessness, use cutting-edge tele-health technology to keep appointments and help state-run veterans homes.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Five more Oakland County manufacturers will share $100,000 in “Saving Business, Saving Lives” grants to make personal protective equipment such as masks and face shields used in the fight against the coronavirus.
Oakland County Executive David Coulter announced the awards today, which come from a $1 million fund he proposed and was approved by the county Board of Commissioners to incentivize Oakland County manufacturers who can shift production to include personal protective equipment such as masks, gowns, face shields or medical device components.
“Oakland County is blessed to have such a wealth of nimble and talented manufacturing companies who are able to shift their focus to help in the fight against the coronavirus,” Coulter said. “Personal protective equipment remains critical for our health care workers, first responders and now for segments of the public who are returning to the workforce as the economy begins to open. I’m grateful for these companies and their willingness to help.”

D.S. Sales, doing business as Premier International of Wixom: The company has been in business since 2005 and provides die cut foam, fibers and other materials for the auto industry. The company will now include production of face shields in its portfolio.

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County today expanded its free drive-thru COVID-19 testing to include all adults age 18 and over and especially adults who are returning to work.
County Executive David Coulter said the expanded testing is important as Oakland County and the state gradually reopens, which includes resumed operations for many area businesses and manufacturers.
“We all know how important it is for our economy that our residents start working again and our companies and businesses re-engage,” Coulter said. “But we also know we’re not in the clear yet. As more people return to work, we need to be vigilant and mindful that the coronavirus is still with us. I urge anyone with underlying health conditions and those adults who are returning to work to get tested. The great progress we’ve made has put many residents back on the job. We need to keep our guard up.”
Anyone interested in being tested must make an appointment through the Oakland County Health Division’s Nurse on Call hotline at 1-800-848-5533 to schedule an appointment. Results may take at least three days. No doctor’s note or prescription is needed and there is no fee.
The Health Division and Honor Community Health offer drive-thru testing at the Oakland County Complex, 1200 N. Telegraph Road in Pontiac and the South Oakland Health Center at 27725 Greenfield Road in Southfield. The Novi Civic Center, 45175 W. 10 Mile Road, Novi, also offers testing. The locations’ hours and days are:
Southfield: Mondays and Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Pontiac: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Novi: Fridays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
To date, Oakland County Health Division has tested 4,844 individuals at its drive-through sites, 249 of whom have tested positive for coronavirus. That is a test positivity rate of 5%. Public health experts want to see a test positivity rate below 10%.
First responders, essential business employees or anyone who displays symptoms of the coronavirus – fever, trouble breathing, persistent dry cough, have underlying health conditions or are age 60 or older – should schedule an appointment.

​
Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County is providing personnel and resources to the unprecedented flooding in Midland County caused by heavy rains and two dam failures.
“This is the ultimate example of what I mean by Oakland Together,” County Executive David Coulter said. “We, as a county, region, and state, are leveraging our resources in order to help our neighbors up north in Midland County.”
Oakland County’s Incident Management Team is working alongside the Region 3 Incident Management Team to provide on-scene incident management resources in Midland County including the communication support team which has a trailer with the ability to set up a radio system with 100 portable radios as well as connect with other radio systems. The team also has taken the Incident Support Vehicle (see attached photo). Much of the equipment the Incident Management Team is utilizing was purchased through grants obtained by Oakland County’s Emergency Operations Center.
Oakland County’s Incident Management Team consists of personnel from various fire departments, law enforcement agencies, public works departments, public health, and emergency management staff from around the county.
This is not the first time Oakland County’s Incident Management Team has helped its neighbors during a disaster. They responded to the tornado that devastated Dundee in 2010 and more recently assisted with the set up and on-site management of the alternate care site for COVID patients at the TCF Center in downtown Detroit.
In addition, Coulter has authorized Oakland County’s Emergency Operations Center, already in full activation for the county’s COVID response, to send Mike Loper up to the Midland County Emergency Operations Center to help them with their needs as they respond to the flooding. Mike is an Army veteran, a retired police officer, and has worked for the Oakland County Emergency Operations Center for 19 years.
Also, Michigan Task Force 1, which is housed in Holly Township, responded last night with a swift water rescue team. Last fall, Michigan Task Force 1 sent a team to Florida and North Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, the Category 5 hurricane that ravaged the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and Eastern United States.
This all occurs under MABAS – the Mutual Aid Box Alarm System – which is designed to streamline the requesting and providing of emergency and fire services resources across Michigan. Currently, there are 28 MABAS divisions in Michigan covering the state's 7 Emergency Management Regions. Within these regions, there are over 500 fire departments, an Urban Search and Rescue Task Force, Technical Rescue Strike Teams, Hazardous Material Response Teams, and an Incident Management Team.
“I want to thank our local first responders who are running towards the danger to help protect the residents, homes, and businesses of the Midland area,” Coulter said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone impacted by the flooding.”

​Pontiac, Michigan – More than 3,500 small businesses seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will receive grants averaging nearly $4,000 from Oakland County’s $14 million small business stabilization fund, County Executive David Coulter said today.
The grants provide the small businesses with an immediate infusion of capital to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses or other similar expenses that occur in the ordinary course of business.
“Small businesses are vital to Oakland County’s economy and so many of our residents,” Coulter said. “They bring life and value to our communities. These grants provide a substantial boost to many small businesses who have suffered greatly through no fault of their own. We were able to fund nearly 50 percent of the businesses who applied for grants. I applaud the Board of Commissioners for its quick action in funding the program.”
The grants, which totaled nearly $14 million, were awarded in two phases. In April, 797 small businesses received an average of $2,886 from a $2.3 million fund that was created by a grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corp. and a matching grant from the Board of Commissioners.
The county added another $700,000 to create the “Saving Businesses, Saving Lives” grant program to incentivize manufacturers who could transition to making personal protective equipment for health care, hospitals and first responders, bringing available grants to a total of $3 million. Eight manufacturers have shared more than $400,000, with several other companies being considered for grants this week.
After the initial fund was quickly exhausted, Coulter went to the board on April 29 and asked it to quadruple the appropriation because of the profound and immediate need among small businesses. Board approval for an additional $12 million was unanimous.
To qualify for grant consideration, businesses met the following criteria:
The company was in an industry outlined in Executive Order 2020-9 , or any subsequent Executive Order of similar intent, or demonstrates it was otherwise affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as meeting additional criteria.
The company had 50 employees or fewer.
The company needed working capital to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses, or other similar expenses that occur in the ordinary course of business.
The company could demonstrate an income loss as a result of the EO, or the COVID-19 outbreak.
Coulter praised and thanked the teams of local economic development leaders from 12 geographic districts, who evaluated the applications and made recommendations, based on strict MEDC guidelines.
Second phase grant recipients include 2,763 small businesses who were shutout of the first round of funding.
The average grant award for the 3,560 recipients is $3,973
88 small businesses received the maximum award of $10,000
564 businesses received funding in both rounds
Nearly 7,400 small businesses – 17 percent of all businesses in Oakland County – applied for grants. They pegged their need from the COVID-19 pandemic at $80 million.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County will set aside $30 million from their allocation of CARES Act funds for cities, townships, and villages impacted by COVID-19, County Executive David Coulter announced today. Coulter’s administration is taking this step because local communities have also incurred expenses related to the pandemic.
“From the beginning of my administration, my vision for the county has been Oakland Together,” Coulter said. “Oakland Together is about leveraging our strengths in collaboration with our community partners to lift up everyone. That is why we are setting aside $30 million from our share of the CARES Act to support our cities, townships and villages.”
Each city, township, and village will receive funds in proportion to its population with a cap. They will have to follow the same guidance that Oakland County must follow in expending these funds. Once approved by the Board of Commissioners, the county will ask each recipient to verify the expenses meet the guidelines set by the U.S. Treasury.
There is a wide range of allowable expenses including public safety, staff overtime, personal protection equipment, and safety protocols and equipment to prepare to safely re-open, among others. For governments, the funds may not be used as revenue replacement and these pandemic-related expenditures must meet the following criteria:
Additional expenses must account for in their approved budget as of March 27, 2020.
Expenses incurred must be prior to Dec. 30, 2020.
The first round of disbursements will be made by the end of June to meet their budget calendar year. Oakland County plans two additional rounds, likely in August and September.
“The effects of the pandemic run deep in Oakland County. As the former mayor of Ferndale, I understand how quickly an emergency can eat up limited resources,” Coulter said. “We have come together to fight the pandemic, and together we will move forward.”

County Executive David Coulter said the health monitoring and facial covering requirements are among the more visible policies instituted in all county buildings to help ensure the safety of county employees and visitors to county buildings.
“We believe these policies and other steps we have taken will help keep visitors to our county buildings – and our employees – safe and healthy,” Coulter said. “Our team has worked very hard evaluating each building, its public spaces and offices, to determine how we can best serve the public and our employees while maintaining appropriate social distancing and other health protocols. The pandemic has changed our lives. This is the new normal for the foreseeable future.”
During the “Stay at Home” order county government services were provided online, through virtual appointments and with county employees equipped to telework. Starting on May 26, the county will begin a phased return to onsite services with new safety protocols in place.
A host of modifications have been made in lobbies, waiting areas, other public spaces and offices in county buildings to ensure social distancing, including placing markings on floors and plexiglass dividers. Signs posted at building entrances alert the public and employees to the new protocols.
The pandemic caused the county to limit in-person services and postpone others, closing off access to government buildings. Beginning May 26, most county departments will begin taking appointments. Oakland County Circuit Court and most other district courts will continue to do the bulk of their work using video conferencing.
The County Clerk and Register of Deeds will take appointments for such services as obtaining a marriage license or passport, as well as other services. It is best to contact the desired department for instructions.
The county’s Department of Human Resources has created a digital COVID-19 Safety Playbook that details roles and responsibilities for county employees, cleaning and disinfecting practices, building spaces where facial coverings must be worn and what personal protective equipment is required. The Playbook is available for download by cities, villages and townships to give them a framework as they prepare to reopen or expand services that were limited.
“This isn’t about ensuring you follow the rules; it’s about doing our best to protect our fellow employees and visitors, which also means we are protecting our families and those that are most vulnerable,” Coulter said in the Playbook. “As Oakland Together, we can come back safely and serve the community that we love.”

Pontiac, Michigan – A Main Street Oakland County crowdfunding campaign to support downtown small businesses struggling because of the coronavirus pandemic has raised more than $45,000.
The countywide campaign is the first of its kind in the nation to be sponsored by a Main Street program. The funds have been generated from 14 of Main Street Oakland County’s 25 designated communities. Five additional communities are expected to join the campaign on Friday.
“It’s gratifying to see the community support for our downtowns,” Oakland County Executive David Coulter said. “This pandemic has been devastating to small businesses across the country and certainly to our downtowns. The county has allocated nearly $14 million to help small businesses in the county keep their heads above water. Communities understand the importance of these businesses to our downtowns and Oakland County’s economy.”
Main Street Oakland County will match dollars raised by each community at $1 for each $1 contributed, up to $4,000. Eligible communities have until Friday to join the campaign.
Local small businesses are defined as independently owned and operated with 30 employees or less. They will receive critical help with things like rent, payroll, supplies and marketing. This program may be their only funding source in order to stay in business. Funding decisions will be made at the local level. Each community determines campaign dollar amount goal, length of campaign, promotion, and their application, review, and fund distribution process based on needs and priorities.
Eligible communities include Auburn Hills, Berkley, Birmingham, Clarkston, Clawson, Farmington, Ferndale, Franklin, Groveland Township, Hazel Park, Highland, Holly, Holly Township, Lake Orion, Lathrup Village, Leonard, Madison Heights, Oak Park, Ortonville, Oxford, Pontiac, Rochester, Royal Oak, South Lyon and Wixom.
Community partners and supporters interested in donating to their favorite downtown, seeing how close each downtown is to its fundraising goal or learning how the funds would be used should visit 
www.patronicity.com/MSOC
. All donations are coordinated through the Community Foundation of Greater Rochester. Questions about the program can be sent to Main Street Oakland County coordinator John Bry at bryj@oakgov.com.
In 2019, public and private investment in Main Street Oakland County totaled more than $50.2 million and resulted in 450 net new jobs; 60 net new businesses; and contributions of more than 28,460 volunteer hours.
To date, more than $837 million in public and private investments have been made to Main Street downtowns, establishing 1,163 new businesses and generating 8,000 jobs.
Oakland County is the first and still only county in the United States to operate a full-service, county-wide Main Street program.

Pontiac, Michigan – County Executive David Coulter today announced the sale of series of Oakland County Building Authority Bonds that will fund part of a new emergency radio system, refinance outstanding bonds at a lower interest rate and save taxpayers millions of dollars.
The high demand for the bonds resulted in a lower interest rate, benefiting the county and taxpayers. Seven sealed bids were received for the bonds.
“This was a great day for the taxpayers of Oakland County,” Coulter said. “The strong demand for the Building Authority bonds shows that investors are willing to put their dollars behind Oakland County. The credit ratings agencies also displayed strong confidence in Oakland County’s economic and financial health by affirming our Aaa/AAA credit ratings.”
The initial bond sale was scheduled for March 24 but postponed due to the financial crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Since that time, the index used to establish interest rates for tax-exempt bonds has fallen approximately 150 basis points or 1.50 percent.
The exceptional high demand resulted in a lower interest rate on the bonds or a true interest cost of 1.32 percent for bond maturing in the years 2020 through 2039. The bond proceeds will be used to fund a portion of the county’s new emergency radio communication system and to refinance six outstanding Building Authority bond issues. The refinancing portion of the transaction resulted in interest savings of $2,197,300 for the county or local units of government that rent facilities from the county.
Prior to the bond sale, credit rating agencies conducted a thorough review of the county’s economy and finances in order to assign a credit rating. The county’s credit ratings were affirmed by Moody’s Investor Services at “Aaa” Stable and Standards and Poor’s at “AAA” Stable. These strong ratings allow the county to borrow money at a lower interest rate, which translates to taxpayer savings and reflects the general creditworthiness of the County. Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone, P.L.C. served as bond counsel, with Robert W. Baird as municipal advisor on the sale.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Health Officer Leigh Anne Stafford has issued 
Health Order 2020-10
, which extends the provisions in 
Health Order 2020-7
 to include newly opened businesses. It requires daily screening of employees for symptoms and the wearing of face coverings and is aligned with the Gov. Whitmer's orders and guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention for any employees who encounter the public.
"As we begin a phased re-opening of the economy, it is vital that the strict protocols we have in place extend to all open businesses," County Executive David Coulter said. "These protocols protect employees and customers and they will reassure the public that every step is being taken to prevent a second spike of the virus as we shift to new phases of re-opening our economy."
The order, which takes effect immediately, also requires compliance with social distancing measures in previous orders. Exempt from this order are healthcare organizations with an infection control program. 
Screening procedures for employees include checking for fever, preferably with a no-touch thermometer; shortness of breath, and other symptoms such as chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell and
/
or diarrhea (excluding diarrhea due to known medical reason), and extreme fatigue. The screener must also ask whether the employee has travelled internationally or outside of Mich
i
gan in the last 14 days. The Health Order outlines the steps to take when an employee answers yes to any of these questions.
"Oakland County residents have been so supportive practicing social distancing to flatten the curve and slow the transmission of COVID-19," Health Officer Leigh-Anne Stafford said. "While social distancing plays a key role in continuing to reduce transmission, face coverings and employee screenings will be essential as businesses reopen according to the governor's orders."
Persons should not utilize N95 rated masks or surgical masks, as those are critical supplies for healthcare workers, police, fire, EMS, emergency management, or other persons engaged in life
/
saving activities. Businesses are required to post the Health Order at the entrance of their buildings and make it available to members of the public by all reasonable means available.

Pontiac, Michigan – A $20,000 grant from Flagstar Bank to Main Street Oakland County and Downtown Pontiac helped seven Pontiac restaurants create the “Pontiac Restaurant Brigade” and deliver 1,440 free meals to three local hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The brigade – patterned after a similar effort in New Orleans for Hurricane Katrina – has nearly exhausted its funds and is seeking donations to continue feeding essential workers at McLaren Oakland Hospital, St. Joseph Mercy Oakland Hospital and Pontiac General Hospital.
“I’m so grateful for the support our health care heroes have received from the generosity of Flagstar Bank,” County Executive David Coulter said. “These restaurants have gotten a shot in the arm from the grant, which included giving life to three restaurants that were closed due to the pandemic. I encourage businesses or individuals to contribute if they can so this important program can continue. It helps our small businesses and our front-line responders.”
Oakland County is collaborating with a host of community organizations including the Area Agency on Aging 1-B, Oakland Livingston Human Services Agency, Meals on Wheels, Community Housing Network, Hope Warming Center and Oakland Hope Pantry to assist with food and shelter needs for individuals and families. Through the restaurant emergency shelter support program, two or three meals a day are provided to 700 people in Pontiac.
The county also partners with 
mycovidresponse.org
, a collaboration between the Pontiac Community Foundation, Lighthouse of Oakland County and Oakland University, which is feeding approximately 2,500 families a week with door-to-door services as well as assisting with other needs such as finding daycare for essential workers, baby and toddler needs, and providing for seniors who would like a daily phone call to help with loneliness.
The restaurant brigade created a rotating schedule to help feed essential workers. These hospitals have been particularly impacted with Oakland County being among the hardest hit counties in the state with confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths. But the brigade needs additional funding to keep this program’s momentum.
Downtown Pontiac restaurants that prepared and delivered meals are The Liberty Bar, Little Mo, Alley Cat Café, Green Room Café, Fillmore 13 Brewery, Exferimentation and M1. Three of the restaurants had been closed until the grant money became available.
“The Downtown Pontiac Restaurant Brigade is a new way for Flagstar to continue its support of small businesses in Pontiac,” said Beverly Meek, Flagstar Bank director of community reinvestment. “It gives us the opportunity to showcase local restaurants, while supporting our front-line workers and addressing the critical need for food among our seniors and others in the community.”
Main Street Pontiac is accepting tax deductible financial donations to keep fueling the brigade as long as possible. Donations may be sent to Main Street Pontiac through its website at 
http://mainstreetpontiac.org/donate/
“It's been a tough time for all of us as we adjust to the new 'normal' of our lives,” said Chris Jackson, board president for Main Street Pontiac. “Small businesses in Downtown Pontiac, restaurants in particular, have been severely impacted and the available resources are limited.
“The restaurant brigade has provided a lifeline to help sustain our downtown restaurants thanks in large part to Main Street Pontiac's collaboration with Flagstar Bank, Oakland County, and the restaurant owners. Small business is the lifeblood of our community, and we believe that this program, mixed with the resiliency of our small business owners, will lead to a thriving Downtown Pontiac marketplace."
Oakland County is the first and still only county in the United States to operate a full-service, county-wide Main Street program, which focuses on historic preservation and downtown revitalization.
In 2019, public and private investment in Main Street Oakland County totaled more than $50.2 million and resulted in 450 net new jobs; 60 net new businesses; and contributions of more than 28,460 volunteer hours. To date, more than $837 million in public and private investments have been made to Main Street downtowns, establishing 1,163 new businesses and generating 8,000 jobs.
Designated Main Street Oakland County communities include Auburn Hills, Berkley, Birmingham, Clarkston, Clawson, Farmington, Ferndale, Franklin, Groveland Township, Hazel Park, Highland Township, Holly, Holly Township, Lake Orion, Lathrup Village, Leonard, Madison Heights, Oak Park, Ortonville, Oxford, Pontiac, Rochester, Royal Oak, South Lyon and Wixom.

And, we have observed that our guests are taking the call to social distancing seriously. Their diligence played a part in our decision to extend the free park entry.”
Coulter strongly recommended park visitors follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines to prevent the spread of infectious diseases including avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; cover mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze; and most importantly, staying home if you feel sick.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Three area restaurants were awarded “Spirit of Main Street” micro business grants from Genisys Credit Union and Main Street Oakland County.
The awards, announced today by Oakland County Executive David Coulter and Genisys Credit Union, provide a financial boost for businesses severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Trail’s Edge Café in Wixom, Liberty Bar in Pontiac and Honcho/Union Joints Restaurant in
Clarkston, each receive $2,500 “Spirit of Main Street” grants.
“Genisys Credit Union continues to be an important partner for Main Street Oakland County and our Main Street communities,” Coulter said. “Our small businesses continue to suffer from the economic effects of this health crisis, and we are supporting them anyway we can. We are
grateful for the support Genisys provides to our small businesses.”
On Thursday, Coulter said the Board of Commissioners allocated $12 million to a job stabilization grant program to assist small businesses impacted by the coronavirus. The county has allocated nearly $14 million for small business relief in less than two months.
The Genisys-funded grants can be used for a variety of needs, from payroll and paying vendors to making structural improvements to marketing. Liberty is using its award for fixtures as part of its planned re-opening. Union Joints in Clarkston is using it to help cover payroll during the pandemic and Trail’s Edge has used it to pay for vendors and supplies, and as a result, just re-opened. Under the terms of the grant, a minimum dollar-for-dollar match must be provided by the applicant.
“We fund these grants to help attract and retain small businesses and, in turn, build stronger local economies and communities,” said Linda Zabik of the credit union’s corporate social responsibility program.
This is the third year of the partnership between Genisys and Main Street Oakland County. A second round of funding is planned, with a deadline of August 30.
Eligible small businesses must apply through one of the 16 Main Street communities: Auburn Hills, Clarkston, Berkley, Clawson, Farmington, Ferndale, Franklin, Highland, Holly, Lake Orion, Pontiac, Ortonville, Oxford, Rochester, Royal Oak and Wixom. For more information and application forms, go to the Services & Training tab at 
MainStreetOaklandCounty.com
.
This is the first time a small business from Wixom has received a grant and second time for a business in Clarkston. A small business in Pontiac has been awarded a grant each year since the program’s inception. Other MSOC communities which have had grant recipients include Berkley, Clawson, Farmington, Franklin, Highland, Holly, Ortonville, Oxford and Royal Oak.
In 2019, public and private investment in Main Street Oakland County totaled more than $50.2 million and resulted in 450 net new jobs; 60 net new businesses; and contributions of more than 28,460 volunteer hours.
“Main Street Oakland County is a very successful program,” Coulter said. “To date, more than $837 million in public and private investments have been made to Main Street downtowns, establishing 1,163 new businesses and generating 8,000 jobs. Genisys Credit Union has been
such a valuable partner. It understands the importance of supporting small businesses in our downtowns and its financial commitment helps ensure they remain vital and attractive destinations for residents and visitors alike.”

Pontiac, Michigan – Six Oakland County manufacturers will share more than $344,000 in “Saving Business, Saving Lives” grants to make desperately needed personal protective equipment and ventilator components used in the fight against the coronavirus.

Pontiac, Michigan – Many Oakland County small businesses seriously impacted by the coronavirus pandemic will get additional financial relief after County Executive David Coulter and the Board of Commissioners announced that $12 million was added to the county’s small business stabilization fund.
Coulter also announced the county Health Division has begun an aggressive partnership with local fire departments and EMS on large-scale COVID-19 testing in independent living facilities. The program began Wednesday in West Bloomfield and continues today in Southfield and Friday in Birmingham. Additional areas will be added each week. In addition the county has expanded 
drive-thru testing
 to Pontiac, Southfield and will include Novi beginning next week.
“We have over 134 senior living facilities in Oakland County impacted by the coronavirus, which has resulted in more than 1,200 confirmed cases and 313 deaths,” Coulter said. “Our focus is on independent living facilities which often lack the medical staff to conduct large-scale testing. We have formed important partnerships with local fire departments to address this urgent need.”
The Health Division continues to work with skilled care and nursing homes, many of whom have their own capacity to test, and provide necessary assistance. These facilities may receive their testing kits directly from the state.
“We will continue aggressive outreach to ensure senior communities, who are especially vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus, have the resources they need to protect residents and staff from the pandemic,” Coulter said. “Our health officer will continue to monitor these efforts and consider additional health orders that may be necessary.”
On Wednesday, the Board of Commissioners approved the $12 million expenditure after Coulter said the initial $3 million grant package of local and state funding was quickly exhausted by struggling small businesses.
“This allocation quadruples the first stage of our assistance package and provides an immediate infusion of working capital for our small businesses,” Coulter said. “I applaud the Board of Commissioners for moving so quickly and so aggressively to help stabilize a dire reality for our small businesses caused by this global health crisis.”
Nearly 7,400 small businesses – 17 percent of all businesses in Oakland County – applied for grants from the initial fund which was created in late March with a $1.15 million award from theMichigan Economic Development Corp.
The county matched the award and added another $700,000 to create the “Saving Businesses, Saving Lives” grant program to incentivize manufacturers who could transition to making personal protective equipment for health care, hospitals and first responders. Two companies received those grants so far and more are expected to be announced soon.
Last week, about 
800 small businesses were awarded 
grants averaging between $2,500-$5,359, depending on the business location within the county. The grants are to be used to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses or other similar expenses that occur in the ordinary course of business. Small businesses pegged their need at nearly $80 million.
Seeing the overwhelming response and obvious need, Coulter asked the board for additional funding. It was not a tough sell. Board Chairman David Woodward introduced the resolution.
“This was not an issue of do we or don’t we help our small businesses but simply a matter of how much and how quickly,” Woodward said. “These businesses don’t have time to wait. Their need is immediate and profound.”
As in the first round, applications will be evaluated by a team of local economic leaders from each of 12 geographic districts. Recommendations will be made in compliance with strict MEDC guidelines. The maximum award is $10,000.
“These small businesses critical to our economic recovery,” Coulter said. “They bring life to our downtowns; they hire our residents and support our communities. There is no economic engine in Oakland County without them. We must do all we can to help them survive.”

PONTIAC, Mich. – April 27, 2020 – 
Residents in southern Oakland County who have coronavirus symptoms can get drive-thru testing beginning Thursday at the Health Division's South Oakland Health Center by appointment only, County Executive David Coulter said today.
The county collaborated with U.S. Rep.

Testing is Thursday and Friday from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. To make an appointment, call the Health Division's Nurse on Call at 800-848-5533.

"I'm so proud of our residents who have taken the necessary steps to keep themselves and others safe. I applaud Congresswoman Lawrence for her leadership. The residents are the true beneficiaries of this effort."

"Cooperation and coordination are so important when addressing a health care emergency unlike anything we have seen in our lifetimes," Rep. Lawrence said. "I appreciate the opportunity to work with the county executive and his team to bring this essential service to our residents and workers. I encourage those who need it to get tested."
The Health Division and Honor Community Health currently offer drive-thru testing at the Oakland County Complex, 1200 N. Telegraph Road in Pontiac.

The task force will meet regularly, beginning Tuesday, to provide Coulter, the board and the Department of Economic Development & Community Affairs with recommendations the county can use as it plans for its eventual emergence from the coronavirus pandemic. Coulter named the membership today. The first meeting is set for Tuesday.
“I’m confident this bi-partisan group of men and women will provide insightful and practical guidance for me and my leadership team as well as the Board of Commissioners,” Coulter said. “We need to take immediate steps to stabilize our small businesses and non-profit organizations. These individuals have extensive knowledge and wide-ranging experiences across the spectrum that will be useful as we make critical decisions about Oakland County’s future. I’m grateful for their leadership and willingness to serve.”
The leadership team is comprised of co-chairs:
Alan Kiriluk, founder and chairman of KIRCO, a Troy-based real estate development, construction and property management company
Pete Provenzano, chancellor of Oakland Community College
Shannon Striebich, president of St. Joseph Mercy Oakland Hospital
Barbara Whittaker, a procurement and supply chain expert and president of BW Limited
The remaining task force members are:
Chris Barnett, Orion Township supervisor

It will review how operations and services may change and make recommendations on how the county can support local businesses and organizations and help them rebound.
The county has already begun to help struggling small businesses. On Friday the county awarded Small Business Stabilization Fund grants averaging $2,800 to 797 small businesses. The grants provide an immediate infusion of capital to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses or other similar expenses that occur in the ordinary course of business.
Coulter said the overwhelming need prompted him to ask the Board of Commissioners for a second round of funding to support Oakland County businesses. The board is expected to consider the request at its meeting on Wednesday. Information regarding the grant program and first round awardees may be found

.
A second fund awarded two grants to local businesses who transitioned their manufacturing to producing personal protective equipment for health care workers and first responders. Other grants are expected to be announced this week, Coulter said.

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County small businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic will receive $2.3 million in grants from the county’s small business stabilization fund, County Executive David Coulter said today.
More than 700 small businesses received grants, which would provide an immediate infusion of capital to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses or other similar expenses that occur in the ordinary course of business. Coulter said the overwhelming response has prompted him to ask the Board of Commissioners for additional funding to support Oakland County businesses.
Information regarding the grant program and first round awardees may be found 
here
.
“We know our small businesses are suffering,” Coulter said. “The Board of Commissioners and I took swift action to help these businesses. But there is an urgent need to help more businesses and that’s why I’m asking the board to approve additional funding to help these businesses. We always believed this was the first phase of assistance. We need to help them keep their doors open.”
Board Chairman David Woodward said the board would consider the request for additional funding promptly. The board is scheduled to meet on April 29.
“The board also understands this is an unprecedented time for our small businesses and realize they don’t have the luxury of time – their need is immediate,” Woodward said. “We’re committed to doing everything we can to help.”
The stabilization fund was comprised of a $1.15 million grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corp. and a matching grant from the Oakland County Board of Commissioners. The board also appropriated an additional $700,000 for the “Saving Business, Saving Lives’ grants for companies able to pivot from normal productions to manufacture personal protective equipment for health care workers and first responders.
“This fund was created in the early stages of this crisis when we knew small businesses would need immediate financial help to stabilize,” Coulter said. “They are the life blood of our economy and we wanted to get these grants into their hands as quickly as possible.”
Grant consideration was highly competitive as 7,372 small businesses requested assistance. Applications were sorted by 12 geographic districts and evaluated by a team of local economic leaders from each district. Recommendations were based on their reviews and made in compliance with strict MEDC guidelines. The maximum award was $10,000 although the average grant ranged from about $2,500 to $5,359, depending on district.
“We think it’s important that funding decisions were made by community business leaders who know these businesses and see the pain this crisis has caused in their communities,” Woodward said.
Coulter said the county received good news late Thursday when it received additional funding from the federal CARES Act, which will allow the county to offer grants to small businesses. Businesses initially approved for grants were notified electronically today. The second-round
grants could be awarded as early next week. Small businesses who applied for the first round do
not need to file a second application.
To qualify for grant consideration, businesses met the following criteria:
The company was in an industry outlined in 
Executive Order 2020-9
 , or any subsequent Executive Order of similar intent, or demonstrates it was otherwise affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as meeting additional criteria.
The company had 50 employees or fewer.
The company needed working capital to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses, or other similar expenses that occur in the ordinary course of business.
The company demonstrated an income loss as a result of the EO, or the COVID-19 outbreak.

Pontiac, Michigan – An Oxford-based manufacturer of ice hockey equipment and a Pontiac company specializing in knitwear were awarded “Saving Business, Saving Lives” grants to make desperately needed personal protective equipment used in the fight against the coronavirus.
The grants, awarded to Vaughn Custom Sports and Detroit Sewn, were announced today by Oakland County Executive David Coulter. They are the first two companies to receive grants from a $700,000 fund proposed by Coulter and approved by the county Board of Commissioners to incentivize Oakland County manufacturers who can shift production to personal protective equipment such as masks, gowns and face shields.
“I applaud and congratulate Vaughn Custom Sports and Detroit Sewn for stepping up to produce the protective equipment which is vital for the health and safety of our health professionals, first responders, other hospital staff and the patients they serve,” Coulter said. “These grants will allow Vaughn and Detroit Sewn to increase production of gowns and masks and bring back employees who had been laid off because of the pandemic.”
Vaughn, owned by Michael and Arlene Vaughn, manufactures protective equipment such as catch gloves, blockers, leg pads, pants, chest protectors and sticks used by professional and amateur goalies throughout the world. They were awarded $50,000 to produce several thousand high quality protective gowns and caps a week. The grant allows Vaughn to bring back employees and dramatically increase production.
Detroit Sewn, owned by Karen Buscemi, was awarded $25,000. It began operations in downtown Pontiac in 2015. The company specializes in knitwear such as T-shirts, bags and other clothing items and is shifting production to making cotton fabric medical face masks for health care systems and first responders across the metro area. The grant will allow Detroit Sewn to invest in equipment and hire employees resulting in a significant increase in production.
Round one applicants were interviewed by a panel on Thursday and Friday. Sixty companies applied in the initial round. Those companies that did not receive grants today are still being considered for funding.
“These panelists are accomplished leaders in their respective fields,” Coulter said. “The work this panel does is so important to these businesses and ultimately the health care systems and first responders. I appreciate their willingness to share their expertise and give so freely of their time.”
Panel members were:
Manager Alain Piette, MI-SBTDC Technology Team
Dr. Carmine Jabri, co-founder of E.M.M.A. International Consulting Group, Inc.
Jaideep Rajput, Director, Commercialization of Beaumont Health
Michael W. Long, Ph.D., executive director of Oakland University Mobilization Zone
Julie Killian, CPA, Clayton & McKervey
Dan Radomski, director, Lawrence Technological University Centrepolis Accelerator
County Commissioners County Commissioner Janet Jackson, D-Southfield; William Miller, D-Farmington
and Michael Spisz, R-Oxford, participated in an advisory role.
A business applying for a grant must demonstrate the ability to execute the project during the
Covid-19 pandemic. Eligible use of funds includes:
Procuring necessary equipment to manufacture supplies
Logistics, shipping, technology upgrades
Other costs related to operationalizing new product lines.
Companies interested in applying for funding have until April 23 to complete the process at:

Pontiac, Michigan – At approximately 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 14, Oakland County experienced a data leakage of internal COVID-19 data used by the Oakland County Health Division for public health analysis. The information was shared on the WeChat application. The data was secured at 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday morning.
The data leakage was of a non-public map that was unintentionally marked as public during a recent upload. It included COVID-19 positive case information including gender, race, age, address, and mortality status. It did not include name, social security number, or any other health information. The dashboard and the county map at 
OakGov.com
 were also not part of this incident.
“Information security, especially around data critical to Health Division’s analysis during this pandemic, is of vital importance to the IT Department,” said Mike Timm, Oakland County’s director of Information Technology. “We are taking additional precautions going forward including no longer sharing internal GIS data by link but rather within our own private environment.”
From the investigation, the exposure began at 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, peaked at 10:00 p.m. and declined by midnight. The individual access to the GIS URL appears to be limited to fewer than 100 WeChat users based on a test run by the IT Department, although some of those may also be duplicates. There is no evidence that this URL was shared outside of WeChat and it is no longer available in that application. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has been informed of the incident by the Health Division.
“We are grateful to the WeChat users who reported the inappropriate use of this information to our department immediately,” Timm said.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County will begin drive-thru COVID-19 testing Thursday for first responders, essential business employees and Pontiac residents who display symptoms of the coronavirus, County Executive David Coulter said.
The county, in partnership with Honor Community Health, will offer testing from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Thursday and weekdays after that at the county complex at 1200 N. Telegraph Road in Pontiac. It is expected that between 50-100 tests will be offered the first two days and capacity will increase to 250 tests a day next week. Results are expected within 24-48 hours.
“We are grateful that Honor Community Health is working with us to provide much needed testing,” Coulter said. “It’s important for our first responders and essential business employees such as those who work in grocery stores, pharmacies and restaurants remain healthy and safe. Our efforts at stopping the spread of the virus are working but we can’t let down our guard.”
First responders, essential business employees and Pontiac residents who display symptoms of the coronavirus – fever, trouble breathing, persistent dry cough, have underlying health conditions or are age 65 or older – should call the Health Division’s “Nurse on Call” hotline at 1-800-848-5533 to schedule an appointment.
Pontiac was identified by the county’s Health Division as a location where fewer residents have been tested than in other communities. Testing will be opened to others as capacity increases, Coulter said.
“Instead of requiring a doctor’s prescription for the testing, the medical director from our Health Division will issue a standing order on who meets the guidelines for a test,” Coulter said. “We want to make this as barrier-free as possible. We must identify the extent of the virus in our communities and address the problem.”
The Health Division today issued a new emergency order requiring essential business employees who provide goods and services and has face-to-face contact with the public or is in close contact with goods the public may purchase, shall wear facial coverings. The covering should fit snugly
over the face and mouth and can be homemade or store bought.
The employees should not use surgical masks and other more protective masks normally worn by health care workers and first responders as those masks are in short supply.
The health order encourages immediate compliance. It becomes mandatory on April 27.
The order continues the requirement that essential businesses perform daily screening for all employees, including:
Checking for symptoms of the coronavirus
Determining if the employee has traveled domestically or internationally within the past 14 days
Any close contact within the past 14 days of anyone with a COVID-19 diagnosis
If an employee answers “yes” to any of the questions, the health order requires the employee be excluded from work.
The complete order is available at 
www.oakgov.com/COVID

​Oakland County Executive David Coulter is launching efforts to gather more data that allows public health officials to fully analyze the county's COVID-19 data on the basis of race and ethnicity.  The county currently has information about the race of close to 52% (4/9/20 12:30 p.m.) of Oakland County residents who have tested positive from novel coronavirus.
"It is vital to have racial data during this pandemic to help understand the breadth of COVID-19 and which communities it is impacting, especially since we know health disparities by race are well established," said Coulter. "Because racial data is not always collected by labs or for other reasons, Oakland County Health Division is taking proactive steps to revisit each case lacking racial data to build a more complete picture."
“I applaud Oakland County for recognizing the need to evaluate demographic data related to the spread of COVID-19,” said Representative Brenda Lawrence (MI-14). “To get a better understanding of the disproportionate impact on communities of color, we must have the ability to analyze data to implement recommendations to the unique challenges of impacted populations”
Residents can view the percentage of cases by race on the county's coronavirus website, OakGov.com/COVID. Close to half of positive cases in Oakland County are missing racial or ethnic information. Recent expansion of the county's case investigation team and changes to the case investigation process will proactively gather race and ethnicity information for past and future cases.
"In Oakland County, African Americans comprise 13.7% of Oakland County residents, but at this point represent 24.4% of our COVID-19 infections," said Leigh-Anne Stafford, health officer for Oakland County.  "We expect to see a continuation of racial disparities in our cases as more data is gathered."
"While this information helps us paint a picture, I stress that any of us is at risk of getting COVID-19. All of us must take the maximum precautions. Follow the governor's orders and take all recommended preventative actions," Coulter said. 
Coulter encourages residents to follow public health protocols including Governor Whitmer's 
Stay Home, Stay Safe
 and 
local health orders
, 
frequent and thorough hand washing
, and 
social distancing
.
As of 1:00 p.m. today the total number of COVID-19 cases in Oakland County is 4,558 and 289 deaths.

Pontiac, Michigan – Companies that shift or accelerate their manufacturing capabilities to produce personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks and gowns used by frontline health care professionals fighting COVID-19 can apply for grants from a $700,000 fund created by Oakland County.
County Executive David Coulter said the personal protection equipment “Saving Business, Saving Lives” grant provides immediate capital for Oakland County companies to ramp up production of PPE or those that can convert operations to produce critically important equipment needed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The county has more than 500 businesses that are clothing and sewing manufacturers, plastics and 3D printing and automotive and paint suppliers.
“We know this is a critical time for our health care professionals and first responders who are desperately short of needed protective equipment but continue to risk their lives helping save others during the coronavirus pandemic,” Coulter said. “We also know there is incredible manufacturing might in our county and these companies want to answer the call. This grant will help them respond to this crisis while infusing them with a boost to move quickly.”
A business applying for a grant must demonstrate the ability to execute the project during the Covid-19 pandemic. Eligible use of funds includes:
Procuring necessary equipment to manufacture supplies
Logistics, shipping, technology upgrades
Other costs related to operationalizing new product lines.
Interested companies can apply at 
https://www.oakgov.com/covid/businessrelief/Pages/Saving-Businesses-Saving-Lives-Grant.aspx
. The $700,000 grant is part of a $1.85 million small business stabilization fund created by Coulter and the county Board of Commissioners. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation also awarded the county a $1.15 million grant.

​Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases doubled overnight. They went from a total of 29 on Sunday to a total of 60 on Monday, an increase of 31 deaths, which prompted County Executive David Coulter to plea with residents to stay home.
"Any of us is at risk of getting COVID-19… All of us must take the maximum precautions at this time. Please, please, please stay home. Follow the governor's orders. Take this seriously. We have not reached our peak yet," Coulter said.
He also announced that residents can now view the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by zip code on a map which can be found on the county's coronavirus website, 
OakGov.com/COVID
. Coulter and the Oakland County Health Division cautioned that these maps do not provide a complete picture of how the disease is being transmitted. The maps show in which zip codes confirmed COVID-19 cases live, but do not indicate where they were exposed to the disease.
"Although there may be a higher rate in a certain city, village, or township or zip code, that is not necessarily where they were exposed," said Leigh-Anne Stafford, Oakland County health officer.
"Just because a community has more or fewer cases, it is not an indication of the relative safety in those communities," Coulter said. "COVID-19 is in every community in Oakland County. No matter where you live, you should stay at home and take the precautions we've talked about so often, especially if you must go out."
There are numerous factors which can contribute to a higher number in a community including access to health care, access to COVID-19 testing sites, and it could be an indication of something going on in the community.
The total number of COVID-19 cases in Oakland County as of 4 p.m. today is 1,403, ranging in age from 14 days to 97-years-old. For more information, go to Oakland County's COVID-19 dashboard at

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Executive David Coulter and Board of Commissioners Chairman Dave Woodward joined together today to announce plans to create a $3 million small business stabilization fund to provide immediate help for small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Coulter made the announcement today, the day after the county was notified of an award of a $1.15 million grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corp. and its Michigan Small Business Relief Program. The state grant will assist qualifying small businesses with up to $10,000 to help offset losses or expenses resulting from the coronavirus emergency. The state is expected to distribute the money to the county by April 1.
“We are grateful for the state’s support and it is a great first step but more needs to be done,” Coulter said. “Shuttered businesses are driving unemployment increases at unprecedented rates. Oakland County saw nearly 16,000 more individuals apply for unemployment last week.
“We know small businesses are desperate and need immediate assistance. The board and I are taking swift action to help our small businesses. We want to get this money in their hands as soon as possible. They are the life blood of the economy and we know they have been seriously impacted by this public health emergency. We are grateful for the state’s support.”
Coulter said $700,000 of the stabilization fund will be used to encourage companies to shift their manufacturing capabilities to the manufacture of personal protective equipment for hospitals and health care workers such as face mask, gowns and other needed items.
“The Board of Commissioners is committed to keeping our small businesses in operation and our health care systems above water, supporting their many employees and keeping our residents safe,” said David Woodward, board chairman. “It is important for us to move quickly. We don’t have the luxury of time.”
Coulter said the county’s manufacturing base is well-equipped to transition from their current products to needed protective health care supplies.
“We have over 500 businesses that are clothing and sewing manufacturers, plastics and 3D printing and automotive and paint suppliers,” Coulter said. “We need to lean in and lead now for the safety and welfare of those that are fighting on the front-lines of this virus.”
Oakland County represents 21 percent of the state’s gross domestic product. Coulter said the county is in contact with local banks to ask them to contribute to the small business relief effort.
In order to qualify for grant support, businesses must meet the following criteria:
The company is in an industry outlined in Executive Order 2020-20 or any subsequent Executive Order of similar intent (“EO”), or demonstrates it is otherwise affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as meeting additional criteria.
The company has 50 employees or fewer.
The company needs working capital to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses, or other similar expenses that occur in the ordinary course of business.
The company can demonstrate an income loss as a result of the EO, or the COVID-19 outbreak.
Grants may be used for working capital to support payroll expenses, rent, mortgage payments, utility expenses, or other similar expenses that occur in the ordinary course of business.
Applications for grant consideration will be available next week online at 
OakGov.com/COVID
. Coulter said a panel is being formed from downtown development authorities, local communities and area chambers of commerce to review grant applications and make recommendations to the county.
“We believe this is the first phase of support for our businesses,” Coulter said. “We need to keep their doors open first and foremost.”

Pontiac, Michigan – The Oakland County Health Division today issued an emergency order requiring essential businesses to screen all employees for illness, exposure to COVID-19 and establish a social distancing protocol for customers and employees to reduce the transmission of the coronavirus.
Oakland County Executive David Coulter made the announcement today during a remote news conference from the L. Brooks Patterson Executive Office Building in Waterford. The media was asked to either phone in or follow it live on Facebook. The order builds on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s “Stay home, stay safe” order issued Monday.
“Gov. Whitmer’s ‘Stay home, stay safe’ order is vital to stop the spread of the virus, keep people healthy, and stabilize hospitals,” Coulter said. “Our health order provides guidelines to those businesses still operating to keep their employees and the public safe.”
The order, which takes effect Wednesday at noon requires, businesses to develop and implement a daily screening program for all staff which includes questions about possible symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. It also asks whether the employee has traveled domestically or internationally in the past 14 days. The employee could be required to stay home for three to 14 days, depending on the answer.
Businesses must also develop and implement a plan to manage and control social/physical distancing (at least six foot spacing) for employees working alongside one another and customers waiting in lines within or outside the business using visual markings, limit building capacity and post the new protocol at the business entrance.
Coulter also cautioned residents that scammers are trying to prey on unsuspecting people by asking for items and cash. Any requests for assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic will be made through the news media or verified @OakGov channels. No one will contact you individually. If you are unsure whether a request for help is legitimate, please call our COVID-19 Helpline at 248-858-1000.
Coulter also thanked those who dropped off personal protection equipment at Oakland County Farmer’s Market Monday after he put out the call for donations. On the first day, HoMedics, which is headquartered in Commerce Township, donated 10,000 N95 masks. In addition, others
dropped off 20,000 surgical masks and 6,000 pairs of safety glasses. There still is a great need for donations. Keep them coming.
Coulter encouraged residents to follow recommended heath protocols, including frequent and thorough hand washing, social distancing and staying home if sick. Residents with questions about the disease should call the Heath Division’s Nurse on Call phone line at 1-800-848-5533. Residents with non-health calls should call 248-858-1000.
The county also will also send text messages with updates on the coronavirus. Those interested should text oakgov to 28748.

Oakland County, Michigan – Itching to get out of the house and wondering where you can go safely – without opening your wallet – now is the time to visit an Oakland County Parks and Recreation park.
Until April 30, all park entrance fees have been waived, allowing anyone to enjoy the splendor of the Oakland County day-use parks and dog parks at no charge. The waiver was announced jointly by County Executive Dave Coulter, the County Board of Commissioners and the Oakland County Parks and Recreation Commission in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Our park system is an incredible county asset and the Oakland County Health Division says getting fresh air during a pandemic can be beneficial," Coulter said. "It is vital, however, that those who visit a county park or go outdoors for any reason continue to practice safe practices such as social distancing, hand washing and take along hand sanitizer."
The Oakland County Parks system offers nearly 80 miles of trails and encompasses 7,000 acres. The parks system has trails for walking, hiking, mountain biking and equestrian riding. OCPR's website 
   
oaklandcountyparks.com
 features detailed information about each location. The normal charge for the day-use park is $5 per car for Oakland County residents and $12 regular rate.
"We understand the value that parks provide to Oakland County residents," Parks Executive Officer Dan Stencil said. "For 54 years, our parks have been a place to relax, revitalize and recreate. In light of COVID-19, the Oakland County Parks are now an even more valuable place to walk, hike, and get outdoors."
Coulter strongly recommended park visitors follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines to prevent the spread of infectious diseases including: avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; cover mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze; and most importantly, staying home if you feel sick.
The parks and dog parks that are open include:
Addison Oaks County Park, 1480 West Romeo Road, Leonard
Catalpa Oaks County Park, 27735 Greenfield Road, Southfield
Highland Oaks County Park, 6555 Milford Road, Highland
Independence Oaks County Park, 9501 Sashabaw Road, Clarkston
Independence Oaks County Park-North, 10089 Sashabaw Road, Clarkston
Lyon Oaks County Park and Dog Park, 52251 Pontiac Trail, Wixom
Orion Oaks County Park and Dog Park, 2301 W. Clarkston Road, Lake Orion
Red Oaks Dog Park, 31353 Dequindre, Madison Heights
Red Oaks County Park, 30300 Hales Street, Madison Heights. The nature center is closed, but the trails are open.
Rose Oaks County Park, 10501 Buckhorn Lake Road, Holly
Waterford Oaks County Park, 1702 Scott Lake Road, Waterford.
All playgrounds, park buildings and restrooms are closed. However, portable restrooms are provided at all locations. A complete listing of portable restroom locations is also posted at oaklandcountyparks.com.
On Monday, modern restrooms will be open at Addison Oaks, Independence Oaks, Orion Oaks and Waterford Oaks county parks. Park staff will maintain clean and healthy facilities in accordance with CDC guidance.
These locations will also be listed on OaklandCountyParks.com.
"Be sure to bring water bottles to keep hydrated," Stencil said. "And share your outdoor adventures on our social media pages for those who may be unable to leave their homes. Experiencing nature uplifts everyone's spirit."

Pontiac, Michigan - The Oakland County Health Division today issued
emergency orders to close all shopping malls, playground equipment and require all childcare
centers to develop and implement a daily screening protocol for children, staff, parents and
visitors to reduce the transmission of the coronavirus.

Oakland County Executive David Coulter said additional steps are under consideration. He urged
residents to shift to essential activities to protect our community and our hospital systems. He
also discussed the shortage of critical supplies at our hospitals and encouraged medical offices
who are cancelling not urgent dental and other procedures to donate Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE) they have in their inventories.
“The steps we take today – as individuals, businesses and government – will save lives,” Coulter
said. “We have to protect our hospital systems so they stay equipped to help the very sickest. We
can get through this together, but we have to act together.”
The order closing Oakland County shopping malls takes effect at noon today. Shopping malls are
defined as a large indoor retail complex containing a variety of stores and often restaurants and
other business establishments housed in a series of connected or adjacent buildings or in a single
large building.
The ban on indoor and outdoor playground equipment takes place immediately. Playground
equipment in childcare centers and areas without playground equipment such as walking trails
and grassy areas are exempt from the order.
The childcare order, which takes effect Monday, requires the development and implementation of
a daily screening program for all staff, children, parents, and visitors. Non-essential visitors are
restricted from the daycare. Everyone would be screened for symptoms of a respiratory infection
such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat; and close contact in the last 14 days
with someone with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Procedures must be in place to take the
temperature of all covered individuals. 
The orders are effective until April 17. The Michigan Public Health Code gives the Health Division
and Health Officer Leigh-Anne Stafford the authority to issue emergency orders.
“A communicable disease coronavirus which causes COVID-19 has been identified that can be
transmitted from person to person,” the order states. “In order to control and limit the spread of the
communicable disease, it is necessary to prevent people from coming into contact with uninfected
people.”
Residents with questions about the disease should call the Heath Division’s Nurse on Call phone
line at 1-800-848-5533. Residents with non-health calls should call 248-858-1000.
The county also will also send text messages with updates on the coronavirus. Those interested
should text oakgov to 28748.

Pontiac, Michigan – Customers who use Oakland County's online services to pay for parking tickets, dog licenses, legal documents or delinquent property taxes will not incur a credit card or electronic check fee beginning next week.
Oakland County Executive David Coulter today said the county would waive fees for online transactions to encourage residents and customers to use the online services rather than visiting a county office to make a payment in-person. The initial waiver period is March 25-April 30.
"I encourage those who have business with the county to use our online services to mitigate the risk of the coronavirus," Coulter said. "The health of our residents, customers and our employees is paramount. I want to reduce any financial barriers to using the online services. If we can limit the exposure to our residents, and save them some money at the same time, that's an easy call to make."
The county currently charges an access fee to make an online purchase. The fee covers the costs related to software, information technology support and a fee charged by the financial institution. Reprogramming of software to allow the waiver should be completed by March 25.
"We are also asking our vendors, our payment processors, to help us and our customers by reducing their fees during this time period," Coulter said. "We appreciate their willingness to support this effort."
The Enhanced Access Fee per transaction depends on the amount of each transaction. A transaction under $50 or payment with an electronic check is $2.50. A transaction over $1,000 requires a fee of 2.75 percent of the order. The complete fee schedule under the county's G2G Cloud Solutions is found at 
https://www.oakgov.com/cart/fee/enhanced_win.html
.
 
Online transactions are available for many Oakland County services through various departments. They include but not limited to the following transactions:
Register of Deeds
Birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses
Case searches
Animal Shelter and Pet Adoption
Dog licenses
Animal Shelter donations
Circuit and Probate Court
Regular and certified copies
Judge Online
Environmental Health
Private sewage licenses
Food services licenses

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Executive David Coulter today announced the formation of “Secure IT Oakland,” a cybersecurity and infrastructure task force to assist local communities prepare and defend themselves from cybercriminals and cyberattacks.
Coulter made the announcement in Troy during the two-day Cyber-Physical Systems Security Summit, sponsored by the Michigan Chapter of the National Defense Industrial Association.
“Industry experts indicated there is a one in three chance an organization will experience a data breach within two years at an average cost of $8.19 million,” Coulter said. “Ransomware everywhere is on the rise, including a projected doubling of attacks on state and local governments. These modern attacks are not simply expensive inconveniences – they put people’s health, safety and lives at risk due to important services not being available when needed. Luckily, there have been no confirmed ransomware-related deaths to date, but that luck may not continue into 2020 and beyond. We can and must do better.”
Leading the task force will be:
Ken Theis, CEO of Dewpoint, a Lansing-based information technology provider
Jennifer Tisdale, principal at GRIMM, a Grand Rapids-based cyber research firm
Mike Timm, Oakland County IT director
Coulter said the need is obvious. Oakland County has more than 100 local units of government and a population of 1.25 million people. The task force will provide a comprehensive list of solutions for the challenges faced by the communities and residents. He has asked for a report in 120 days.
“I am confident with Ken’s public sector experience as the state of Michigan’s former chief information officer, Jennifer’s leadership in this cybersecurity space in Michigan over the last seven years at the Michigan Economic Development Corp. and in the auto industry, and with Mike and his experienced team at Oakland County, they will help us improve our cybersecurity and infrastructure security across the county,” Coulter said.
Oakland County’s Tech248 initiative, which connects the county’s 2,000-plus tech companies, frequently focuses on cybersecurity at its monthly meetups.
The group’s March 23 meetup begins at 3 p.m. and is entitled, “Cybersecurity and You.” It will be held at VR Life Arcade, 320 N. Telegraph Road in Pontiac. Registration is free at

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County’s 200th birthday is March 28 and the county has partnered with the Detroit Zoo for a special celebration admission rate of $10 for county residents – a $9 savings off the regular same-day ticket price.
Residents – 2,020 of them – will be able to enjoy the zoo for the day at the discounted rate, simply by taking a fun, interactive quiz at 
Oakland200.com
 and answering a few questions about Oakland County’s history. (HINT: A true-false question asks whether Oakland County Government was formed before Michigan was granted statehood in 1837. If this is Oakland County’s 200th birthday and you subtract 200 from 2020… you get the idea.)
“This is the first of many events that will be held to celebrate our bicentennial and our fascinating history,” Oakland County Executive David Coulter said. “Oakland County evolved from an agricultural producer to a global leader in automotive manufacturing to a center of research and development, business and international investment. We celebrate our history as we eagerly await the promise and wonder of our next 200 years.”
To get the discount, residents (age 18 and over) are asked to take the six-question quiz. Once completed, follow the instructions to access a special registration page where the voucher for discounted tickets (limit five per resident) will be revealed. Those who present the printed voucher at the zoo – and have proof of Oakland County residency – will be admitted for $10. Residents must present the printed voucher for the discounted admission.
On July 18, Southfield Parks and Recreation, Oakland County Parks and Recreation and Oak Park Recreation presents Rhythm & Rhymes, a free outdoor music festival on the front lawn of the Southfield Municipal Complex.
As part of the bicentennial celebration, the Oakland County Board of Commissioners has authorized the purchase of 20,000 oak seedlings for planting. They will be distributed to schools and communities throughout the county. The board is also funding the purchase of an oak sapling
and a commemorative plaque for each of the county’s 62 cities, villages and townships. A complete list of bicentennial activities is found at 
Oakland200.com
.
Oakland County will generally, upon request, provide appropriate aids and services where necessary to afford persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, county programs, services, and activities, including qualified sign language
interpreters, documents in Braille, and other ways of making information and communications accessible to people who have speech, hearing or vision impairments.
For accommodations, translations, complaints, and additional information, please contact Jamie Fenner at 248-858-1049 or fennerj@oakgov.com.

Pontiac, Michigan – County Executive David Coulter’s management team was viewed as
“very strong” by Standard and Poor’s (S&P) when they assigned a AAA long-term rating to Oakland
County. Coulter and team, with a bi-partisan group of Commissioners, met with S&P last week to
describe ambitious plans and continued adherence to strong fiscal policies.
“My administration is committed to balanced budgets, fiscal responsibility, and moving Oakland
County forward together. That is what my team presented to S&P and it is great to now have
their validation with the highest rating possible – AAA,” 
Coulter said. 
“This rating is positive
news for the residents of the county because it allows us to cut the price tag of government.”


The AAA bond rating will enable the county to finance two bond issues at the best market rates
possible, saving a significant amount of money. One bond issue is for the Oakland County Building
Authority which will include a new public safety radio system. The other for a Water Resources
Commissioner project in Farmington Hills.

“It has been my top priority to keep this AAA hallmark of Oakland County’s economic prowess
while leveraging our strengths and addressing our challenges. As I said at the State of County,
we can be fiscally responsible with the taxpayer’s money and forward-thinking.


“I brought my leadership team with me so S&P could hear our ambitious plans and commitment
to fiscal discipline,” 
said Coulter.
 “I want to thank the Board of Commission, who sent bi-
partisan representation with us, to reinforce our government is working together.”


S&P said in a report published online that their rating reflects Oakland County’s “very strong
management, with strong financial policies and practices...” They also acknowledged the recent
change in administration and 
“continued adherence to strong policies and comprehensive
planning,”
(emphasis added).

The report went on to state their rating is a “reflection of what we consider to be a large amount of
discretionary spending, low fixed costs, and 
our positive view of the management team
, which actively
monitors the budget and is capable of anticipating and addressing challenges,” (emphasis added).

Background

The Oakland County Building Authority Bond will fund $18.5 million of the county’s new $57 million
public safety radio system, replace its aging, 15-year-old radio system. The new Motorola P25 radio
system will provide coverage for all law enforcement, fire, and EMS in the county and improve
interoperability with Oakland County’s neighbors and state agencies. It will include 5,500 radios, 31
towers, and 76 dispatch consoles. The principal and interest will be paid for by a 911 surcharge.

The building authority bond will also refinance five other building authority bonds that total $25,760,000:
Series 2010, Series 2011A, Series 2011B, Series 2011, and Series 2012. The refinancing will save
taxpayers over $1 million in interest. The bonds will be sold by sealed bid later in March.

The $3,945,000 Evergreen Farmington Sewage Disposal System Bond will finance an Oakland County
Water Resources Commissioner project to maintain capacity and performance in Farmington Hills by
installing a new system with 3,700 linear feet of 36-inch thermal cured-in-place sewer line and 16
manholes. Revenue from the system will pay for the principal and interest of the bonds. The bonds will
be sold by sealed bid on March 12.

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County Health Division reports a confirmed animal rabies case in a skunk in Lake Orion. Human exposure to the skunk is unlikely. The Health Division strongly urges residents to avoid stray, wild, and dead animals to protect yourself against rabies.

Rabies is present in our communities and is most often found in bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. If you or your household pet are exposed to any wild animal or an animal unknown to you, wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and water. Then seek medical or veterinary attention immediately, even if your animal was previously vaccinated. The rabies virus is found in the saliva of infected animals and is spread through bites or scratches. Rabies is not spread through a skunk’s spray. To report potential rabies exposure, call the Health Division at 248-858-1286.
Follow these simple steps to protect yourself from rabies:
Have pets vaccinated regularly.

exposure to wild animals that may be rabid.
Do not leave food or water outside for pets when unattended.
Keep garbage securely covered, as these items may attract wild or stray animals.

Waterford, Michigan – Companies, labor organizations and educational partners interested in participating in the third annual MiCareerQuest Southeast, scheduled for November 18, 2020, are invited to attend a special kickoff meeting on Monday, March 9, from 1:30-3:00 p.m., at the L. Brooks Patterson Executive Office Building Conference Center, 2100 Pontiac Lake Road in Waterford. Registration is available at 
www.advantageoakland.eventbrite.com
.
The largest career exploration event for high school students in the region, MiCareerQuest Southeast is not only a hit with teenagers, but also sponsors and exhibitors who showcase hundreds of in-demand jobs in advanced manufacturing, construction, health sciences and information technology.
“MiCareerQuest Southeast has quickly become one of the most popular career events for high school students across southeast Michigan,” said Oakland County Executive David Coulter. “Planning for this year’s event starts now and we strongly encourage businesses and others interested in joining us to get involved early as a sponsor or exhibitor, so they can actively participate in our quadrant planning meetings and receive maximum exposure for their involvement.”
Last year’s event drew nearly 10,000 students and chaperones from 160 high schools across southeast Michigan. Post-event surveys indicated 89 percent of the exhibitors thought it was an effective way to showcase their industries to the future workforce.
The students agreed. Of the 1,100 students who completed the survey, 82 percent said they learned about employment and education/training opportunities that they did not know about beforehand; 72 percent thought
MiCareerQuest Southeast would help them make their career choices after high school graduation.
MiCareerQuest Southeast will again take place at the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi and cover nearly 400,000 square-feet of floor space. Organizers expect upwards of 200 career paths to be highlighted. There will be 20-25 exhibitors in each quadrant.
Sponsor contributions cover a range of costs associated with hosting an event of this size and scope. There are platinum, gold, silver, bronze and supporter sponsorships available, each with a range of benefits. More details, including a summary of sponsorship benefits and the schedule for the quadrant meetings, can be found at 
www.OakGov.com/MiCareerQuestSE
.
“We expect the majority of exhibitors from last year to return, but we have room for new organizations to join us,” said Jennifer Llewellyn, director, Oakland County Michigan Works! “We look forward to seeing new faces at this year’s kickoff, where we will be sharing important information on how we are making it even more impactful for everyone involved.”
Dorsey Schools have participated in MiCareerQuest Southeast since its inception, both as a sponsor and exhibitor in the health sciences quadrant.
“MI Career Quest is one of the most positive, educational and fun learning experiences I have ever been involved in,” said Eric Strouse, vice president, Dorsey Divisions. “The students get a chance to learn about careers in a hands-on environment without any pressure and the different companies get a chance to teach aspects of the various jobs while having fun through creating excitement in those careers.”
MIAT College of Technology also has participated in MiCareerQuest for the past two years. In 2019, it partnered with Delta Airlines to highlight career paths and training opportunities.
“This platform has provided our institution the opportunity to expose a tremendous number of students to career pathways in the skilled trades,” said Chris Davis, assistant director of community partnerships, MIAT College of Technology. Last year, we were fortunate to collaborate in our booth with Delta Airlines, one of our aviation partners, to help students understand the opportunities as aviation maintenance technicians. This year, our college plans to engage Delta and additional industry partners to increase the impact of this phenomenal event.”
This year’s MiCareerQuest Southeast is being capped at 9,000 students for the day. School registration will commence in mid-August, with public and private high schools in Oakland, Macomb, Wayne, Livingston, Monroe and Washtenaw counties signing up online. Students can only attend the event if their high school is participating. Homeschool students should contact their local high schools to see if they are planning on attending.

“To move forward as a region we must fix our inadequate transit system. It has economic and quality of life consequences for Oakland County and our region if we don’t better compete with other regions across the country. I’m dismayed that Republicans in the legislature fueled by false information won’t give us the tools we need to develop a plan to put before the voters. Ultimately it should be up to the voters to decide this issue. I’m committed to continuing efforts with local communities to improve mobility throughout Oakland county as we find a path forward as a region. ”

Pontiac, Michigan – Oakland County authorities warn the community of a phone scam targeting older adults with the caller impersonating Oakland County Health Division employees. Numerous older adults reported receiving a phone call from the Health Division requesting social security and Medicare numbers for: Medicare billing, a Medicare breach, or because their doctor said they qualified for a knee brace. Oakland County Health Division does not contact residents to request personal or protected information over the phone.
“This scam targets older adults to obtain their sensitive information by impersonating our organization,” said Leigh-Anne Stafford, health officer for Oakland County. “If you receive a call and are unsure if it is a scam, ask the caller for their name, a return phone number and avoid sharing any personal information over the phone. Then report suspicious behavior to authorities.”

Pontiac, Michigan – A team from Oakland County lead by County Executive David Coulter is heading to Chicago for the county’s bond rating meeting. They will meet Wednesday with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s to ask them to reaffirm Oakland County’s AAA bond rating.
They are seeking the highest bond rating for two bond issues: One for the Oakland County Building Authority which will include financing a new public safety radio system. The other for a Water Resources Commissioner project in Farmington Hills.
“Our message to the bond rating agencies will be about stability and continuity,” Coulter said. “We will demonstrate that Oakland County is continuing its best fiscal practices under a new administration, including passing a three-year budget with unanimous, bipartisan support from the board of commissioners. We can be forward thinking while preserving Oakland County’s strengths.”
The Oakland County Building Authority Bond will fund $18.5 million of the county’s new $57 million public safety radio system, replace its aging, 15-year-old radio system. The new Motorola P25 radio system will provide coverage for all law enforcement, fire, and EMS in the county and improve interoperability with Oakland County’s neighbors and state agencies. It will include 5,500 radios, 31 towers, and 76 dispatch consoles. The principal and interest will be paid for by a 911 surcharge.
The building authority bond will also refinance five other building authority bonds that total $25,760,000: Series 2010, Series 2011A, Series 2011B, Series 2011, and Series 2012. The refinancing will save taxpayers over $1 million in interest. The bonds will be sold by sealed bid later in March.
The $3,945,000 Evergreen Farmington Sewage Disposal System Bond will finance an Oakland County Water Resources Commissioner project to maintain capacity and performance in Farmington Hills by installing a new system with 3,700 linear feet of 36-inch thermal cured-in-place sewer line and 16 manholes. Revenue from the system will pay for the principal and interest of the bonds. The bonds will be sold by sealed bid on March 12.

Pontiac, Michigan – Notable transit expert and advocate Neil Greenberg has joined Oakland County to advise County Executive David Coulter and his administration on developing a public transportation solution that works for all of Oakland County and Southeast Michigan.

Greenberg has nearly 18 years of experience in transit services, including as executive manager of service development & scheduling for the Detroit Department of Transportation and editorial director for CHK America, an information design firm located in Santa Barbara, Calif. specializing in maps, graphics, wayfinding and customer experience tools for transit systems across the US and Europe. He also has held positions at CSG airBus, the Ann Arbor Transportation Authority, SMART, and University of Michigan Transportation Services where he was a bus operator. He also is a regular transit consumer who does not own a car.
“County Executive Coulter invited me to be part of Oakland Together, his vision for leveraging Oakland County’s strengths to collaboratively solve issues, including regional transit,” Greenberg said. “I’m excited to be part of a team that wants to make meaningful progress on making Southeast Michigan economically competitive through better public transportation.”
Greenberg will work in the county’s Planning & Economic Development Services Division as a transit advisor with Manager Bret Rasegan who sits on the SMART Bus Board of Directors along with Chief Deputy County Executive Hilarie Chambers, the chairwoman of SMART. He began his new role Monday, February 24.
