 How  do I prevent myself from getting COVID-19?



The best method of prevention at this point is to practice  social distancing and adhere to the Governor’s Executive Order, “Stay Home,  Stay Safe” 2020-21
There is currently no vaccine to  prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is  to avoid being exposed to this virus. [English. Chinese. Spanish.] Older adults and  people with chronic medical conditions have an increased  risk for serious illness from COVID-19.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue  in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces  using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC)  recommendations for using a facemask.

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask  to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.
Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19  to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks  is also crucial for health  workers and people  who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a  health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20  seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after  blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use an  alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with  soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.






 What should I do if I am sick?



Stay home when you are sick with symptoms of COVID-19, except to get medical care. Symptoms of COVID-19 include   fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider. 
 Isolate Sick Person to Protect Other Household Members

 Stay in a separate room from the rest of your household members. 
 Use a separate bathroom if possible. 
 Keep toothbrushes separate if you must use the same bathroom. 
 Family and roommates should avoid contact with sick person and practice self-quarantine. 
 Wear a mask if you go into shared spaces.
 Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. Learn about disinfecting your   home if someone is sick from CDC.
 Review our specific recommendations for Isolation, Quarantine, Self-Monitoring and Social Distancing.  English.  Spanish. 

 Managing Symptoms at Home

 Stay home to manage mild symptoms of COVID-19   including cough, fever, fatigue, abdominal cramps, mild nausea, vomiting   or diarrhea. 
 Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) up to every 4 hours or   ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil) up to every 6 hours for fever. You can   alternate these if you need relief prior to when the next dose is due.   Do not exceed the maximum dose per day   for any medication. Neither FDA or WHO currently recommend avoiding   ibuprofen. Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about   your personal health.
 Stay hydrated by drinking water or sports drinks. Eat when possible. 
 Avoid other family members and friends by following the Isolation instructions.
 Review 10 ways to manage respiratory symptoms at home from CDC. 

When to Seek Medical Care
 Call your doctor if you have: 

 Fever that does not come down with medication. 
 Vomiting or diarrhea lasting more than 24 hours or any bloody diarrhea. 
 Shortness of breath. 
 Symptoms that keep getting worse and feel unmanageable. 

 Call ahead to the Emergency Department or Call 9-1-1 if you have: 

 Difficulty breathing/inability to catch your breath. 
 Chest pain. 
 Feel faint, light-headed or unstable in any other way. 

 When Seeking Care at a Health Care Facility

 Call ahead to get instructions from your health   care provider. They may want to meet you outside or use a different   entrance than the general public uses. 
 Avoid using public transportation to get to your   medical provider or emergency department. Do not use busses, Uber, Lyft,   or taxi cabs. 
 If you are unable to drive yourself and do not have   a ride, call 9-1-1 for transport by ambulance. Inform them of your   symptoms ahead of time. 
 If a family member or friend is giving you a ride,   wear a mask or fabric that covers your mouth and nose while you are in   the vehicle with them. 
 If you are driving yourself, apply a mask or fabric that covers your mouth and nose before exiting your vehicle. 





 Who  can I call for a medical-related question?



 
Kalamazoo County has our call  center available Monday through Friday from 8:00am to 5:00pm. You can call 269-373-5200. MDHHS Hotline is  available seven days a week from 8:00am to 5:00pm. You can call 1-888-535-6136.
Please note: The local and state call center's staff cannot  provide individual clinical advice or a diagnosis through the hotline. If you  believe you have been exposed to COVID-19 and are symptomatic, call your health  care provider. If you do not have a health care provider, call the nearest  hospital.




 When is it safe to leave home if I had symptoms of COVID-19?


View  this flowchart from MDHHS for information on when it is safe to   leave home if you or a close contact had symptoms of COVID-19. Please   remember, no one should be leaving home for tasks or work that is not   essential. 



 What should I do if I think I’ve been exposed to COVID-19?



View  this flowchart from MDHHS for information on what to do if you think you were exposed to COVID-19. 




 What  do the terms Social-distancing,  self-monitoring, self-quarantine, monitored quarantine, and self-isolation  mean? What do I do if I’m asked to do one of them?



These are newer terms and it can get confusing  by what is meant for each one. Checkout this flyer in English or Spanish (updated as of 3/18/20).




 What is the testing criteria for COVID-19?



The Michigan Department of Health & Human Services (MDHHS) announced on May 26, 2020 that the criteria has expanded for COVD-19 testing. 
 MDHHS COVID-19 test prioritization criteria is now as follows:
 High Priority:

 Hospitalized patients with symptoms.
 Any health care worker, first responder, or congregate care facility worker with symptoms.
 Residents in any congregate care facility, including prisons and shelters, with symptoms.

 Priority:

 Persons with symptoms of potential COVID-19 infection, including:
                        
 Shortness of breath.
 Muscle pain.
 New loss of taste or smell.
 Vomiting or diarrhea.
 Sore throat.


 Asymptomatic patients in preparation for surgical procedures, as deemed necessary by the treating clinician.
 Asymptomatic people with known exposure to a person with COVID-19 or exposure to a person with COVID-19 symptoms.
 Asymptomatic people living or working in a congregate care facility or   other high-risk setting (such as nursing home, jail, prison, homeless   shelter, assisted living facility, etc.) that:
                        
 Had a confirmed case among residents or workers.
 Is located in a region of medium risk or higher, or
 Is receiving patients from an area of medium risk or higher.


 Asymptomatic people who work in a profession that puts them at high risk of exposure, including:
                        
 Repeated close contact of prolonged duration with the public.
 Working in a high-risk profession where clusters of infections have been   identified (such as migrant workers, food processing facilities, etc.).
 Working in-person during a period of strict social distancing or, in   areas with some sectors re-opening, having worked in-person during the   period of strict social distancing.


 Persons identified by clinicians or public health officials who can be tested for public health monitoring research purposes.
 People without symptoms who live in communities where there has been   inequitable access to testing and a need to increase the rate of people   tested per day – such as areas with higher proportion of racial/ethnic   minorities, rural communities.

 Permissible:

 Persons without symptoms who are prioritized by local health departments or clinicians, for any reason.
 Asymptomatic people living or working in a congregate care facility or   other high-risk setting (such as a nursing home, jail, prison, homeless   shelter, assisted living facility) in any region.
 Asymptomatic people leaving their home for work.





 What is the process for obtaining a COVID-19 test?



When a   person visits their provider and are concerned about COVID-19, they may   be asked a series of questions to screen them for possible testing. If   needed, and depending upon laboratory criteria,   they may be asked to give a sample to be submitted for testing. This is   a rapidly evolving process, and testing protocols and availability will   likely change in the future. Laboratories are required to notify HCS of   any positive results of a Kalamazoo County   resident. 

 Screening: Patient is assessed to determine if they will qualify for further care or testing.
 Sampling: A specimen is obtained from the patient.
 Testing: The patient has been identified as needing a COVID test and it is ordered.





 How are diseases and deaths reported for a county?



Like most diseases or   conditions of public health significance, COVID-19 disease is reported   by county of official residence. For example, if a person is diagnosed   with a disease in a hospital within Kalamazoo   County, but resides in another county, the count or report of disease   goes to   their county and county health department of official residence, not Kalamazoo. Or if a  resident of Kalamazoo County travels or attends school in another county, state, or even nation, and becomes sick, the disease   report would be in Kalamazoo County.   This is standard practice for disease and death reporting across the   United States. Local health departments routinely investigate diseases   of public health significance for individuals within their jurisdiction   and coordinate with other local health departments   and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.




 How  do I report a business violating “Stay Home, Stay Safe” executive order?



Residents, visitors and businesses may call  the Kalamazoo County Sheriff’s Office to report any concerns or violations to  the “Stay Home, Stay Safe” Executive Order 2020-21. You may call 269-385-6101, Monday through Friday from 8am to 4pm.




 How do essential service businesses conduct Healthy Workplace Screenings?



The Kalamazoo County Health Officer issued a recommendation on April 2, 2020  for all essential service providers and   businesses in Kalamazoo County to conduct a brief health screening of   workers and implement a social distancing plan to protect everyone’s   health to the greatest degree possible. 

 Healthy Workplace Screening Checklist and Tool
OSHA Guidelines for Employers

Only those operations   deemed critical under the Governor’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe” Executive   Order may remain open in Kalamazoo County.




 How  do I find out what resources are available?



For immediate emotional support or crisis  intervention, call 269-381–HELP(4357). For information, and to get connected to  resources available in your community, dial 2-1-1. Both of these free and  confidential services are provided by Gryphon Place 24/7.
You can also visit the Michigan Department of  Health & Human Services website. On this  site, they have resources listed and specifically a link to how to apply for  unemployment benefits; apply for assistance with health insurance, food, and  other needs; and find local resources in our community (through 2-1-1).  




 How  do I find meals for kids?



The Michigan  Department of Education (MDE) is pleased to announce that an online map has  been developed for families to find locations where meals are being provided  during this period of school closure. The map can be found here, and will be updated twice each day during  the closure period.
You can also visit the Michigan Department of  Health & Human Services website. On this  site, they have resources listed and specifically a link to how to locate a  local school meal pickup site. 




 What do I do regarding custody and co-parenting time during the COVID-19 pandemic?



The Michigan Courts issued a FAQ about custody and parenting time during the COVID-19 outbreak. Within the FAQ there are additional resources and ways people can direct their questions regarding their specific situation. 




 Are  certain races or ethnicities more susceptible to COVID-19?



Discrimination harms public health. People of  Asian descent, including Chinese Americans, are not more likely to get  coronavirus than anyone else. Always share accurate information about a  virus and how it spreads. It is important to remember that stigma and  discrimination occur when people associate an infectious disease, such as  COVID-19, with a population or nationality. COVID-19 does not target people  from specific populations, ethnicities or racial background. Suspected  discrimination can be reported to the  Michigan Department of Civil Rights.




 Should  I wear a face mask?



The CDC now recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public places   where social distancing is difficult to maintain, like grocery stores   and pharmacies. The use of simple cloth face coverings can help stop   people who may have the virus   and do not know it from spreading it to others. Given the current   shortage of masks, HCS is encouraging people to  make their own cloth face coverings and save the N95 and surgical   masks for our healthcare workers and first responders. The U.S Surgeon   General Dr. Jerome Adams demonstrates how to turn a t-shirt into a face covering in this video. 




 How do I make a mask for myself and how do I donate face masks?



You can make your own face covering in the following ways:

 CDC  sew and no-sew instructions
Video demonstration on how to turn a t-shirt into a face cover. 

The Kalamazoo County Government is collecting  home-sewn face masks. Any pattern is acceptable. The fabric should be breathable. Cotton is acceptable. Here are a few suggestions for patterns:

Phoebe Putney Health Systems pattern
Bronson’s Patient & Family Advisory Council pattern
CDC pattern

If you choose to donate a home-sewn face mask then   please drop-off at the Health & Community Services Department at 311   E. Alcott St., Kalamazoo, Michigan 49006, Monday through Friday 9:00   a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
