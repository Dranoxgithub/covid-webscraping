Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessColorado has slowed the spread of COVID-19 through Stay-at-Home and Safer at Home orders, and we must keep it up. The virus is still present in Colorado and can re-surge at any time. Everyone needs to do their part for themselves, their loved ones, and our community. Right now, we are in Level 2: Safer at Home and in the Vast, Great Outdoors. While we are all still safer at home, we are also able to practice greater social distancing in our vast outdoors than in confined indoor spaces. Much of Colorado is now open with restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect those at highest risk for severe illness.People should be prepared for state and local public health orders to be extended, amended, or changed as needed to protect public health. This means we may move between the different levels during this pandemic:(719) 578-3199healthinfo@elpasoco.com

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessThe CDC continues to study the spread and effects of COVID-19 across the United States. It is now known that a significant portion of individuals with COVID-19 lack symptoms. These asymptomatic individuals, along with individuals who will eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”), can transmit the virus to others. This means that the virus can be spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other physical distancing measures are difficult to maintain. It is important to remember that maintaining 6-feet physical distancing remains critical in slowing the spread of COVID-19. The use of face coverings does not replace previous physical distancing recommendations.Surgical masks or N-95 respirators are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. These critical supplies are not recommended for use by the general public. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance.Cloth face coverings should:Avoid using face coverings that are not cotton or woven fabric as they are not recommended to provide protection.Usage and care of cloth face coverings:Tips to follow whenever you need to leave your home:If you would like to sew masks to donate for El Paso County first responders, please follow the guidance below:(719) 578-3199healthinfo@elpasoco.com

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessThinking about COVID-19 can be overwhelming. If you or your loved ones are feeling anxious, worried, angry, or helpless, you are not alone. Here are some healthy ways to address those feelings:Limit the news. Regulate the amount of time you spend watching or reading about the situation. Look to reliable sources for information:Take care of yourself. Make sure you get enough rest and exercise.Do things you enjoy. Read a book, watch movies or TV shows that you have meant to catch up on, learn to cook something new, or do some spring cleaning. Use the web to find online activities (some examples include Fine Arts Center, Metropolitan Opera and the Pikes Peak Library District).Take control.  There are many actions you can take in your daily life to cope with stress, including preparing your household, protecting yourself while running errands and caring for children and pets.Avoid making assumptions. Someone coughing or sneezing does not necessarily have COVID-19. Maintain the required physical distance of six feet and remain empathetic to those around you.Stay Connected.  Use virtual resources (such as FaceTime, Zoom, WhatsApp) to connect with friends and family on a regular basis. Volunteer.  If you are healthy, consider volunteering your time to support organizations that are considered critical businesses. Some have opportunities to volunteer from home.  A list of local and immediate needs can be found here.A full list of resources can be found on El Paso County Public Health’s website.(719) 578-3199healthinfo@elpasoco.com

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessEl Paso County, CO – Today El Paso County Public Health provided an update to the Board of County Commissioners (BoCC) on the Safer At Home Order. At last Thursday’s BoCC meeting, Public Health presented strategies put in place to support a gradual and methodical easing of restrictions with an emphasis on data-driven decisions. To that end, Public Health shared encouraging data:Public Health thanks residents for their diligent efforts during the Stay At Home Order and as we continue into the Safer At Home order. Together as a community, we have made progress in flattening the curve, and this would not be possible without the help of each and every community member.Committed to transparency, Public Health wants to prepare the community for the coming weeks. Now that we have entered the Safer At Home phase, we remain cautiously optimistic but vigilant. By following a gradual loosening of restrictions, it allows Public Health time to assess how this is affecting local case counts and gives hospitals time to assess the impact on local health care infrastructure. Given the incubation period of COVID-19 (up to 14 days), in the next two to three weeks we will begin to see how this next phase has affected the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Our team of data and medical experts, working closely with our hospital and health care partners, will continue to diligently monitor data trends and use this information to drive science-based decision making. Public Health is united with partners around the shared goal of protecting the health of the community and the health of the economy. We will do all we can to encourage the reopening of businesses, but we will do so in a careful, planned and methodical manner. While some of the other front range communities have adopted stricter local public health orders, they have not yet seen the same level of flattening the curve that El Paso County has achieved. Because of our recent decrease in cases and hospitalizations and increases in local testing and contact tracing capacity, Public Health feels confident that we have the processes and plans in place to support gradual reopening. The focus right now is on creating action plans with hospitals and other partners that we will be poised to implement, as long as the data supports these decisions. Recognizing that there is a large volume of new information to process in the Safer At Home Order, Public Health provided a summary of key takeaways. Key takeaways for individuals:Key takeaways for businesses:Key takeaways for recreation:(719) 578-3199healthinfo@elpasoco.com

Scraping from https://www.elpasoco.com/el-paso-county-public-health-presents-restaurant-variance-request-el-paso-county-board-commissioners/


May 14, 2020 – El Paso County Public Health presented a variance request for restaurants to the El Paso County Board of Commissioners today. Commissioners voted to approve the request, which proposes reopening restaurants in El Paso County with common sense safety precautions for patrons, staff, and business owners. Upon final approval by hospitals, the carefully thought out plan will be sent to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment for further review and approval. Public Health collaborated with hospitals and medical experts to create a plan that would allow restaurants to offer in-person dining services, while putting in place processes that will limit the potential for COVID-19 to spread. “We recognize that economic health is a vital part of any community, and we know that local restaurants play a critical role in that,” said Susan Wheelan, director of El Paso County Public Health. “We thank our residents for their patience while Public Health worked with closely with hospitals, community leaders, the business partners and other experts to create a detailed and medically sound plan that aims to help reopen our local restaurants.” “I am excited to support this resolution and get people back to work,” said Board Chair Mark Waller. “Each day that goes by without a variance is another day that many small business owners and their employees step closer to financial disaster.” Commissioners heard from several other experts at this morning’s meeting. “This is going to be a step for us to start figuring out how we’re going to operate our restaurants, and moving forward in a healthy fashion” said Greg Howard, president of the Pikes Peak Chapter of the Colorado Restaurant Association. “Most counties don’t have the strong relationships with health departments that our local chapter does. We are grateful for the relationship with El Paso County Public Health.” Key takeaways from the variance request include:Seating capacity Seating processes Common-use items and areas Masks “I would echo the words of Mr. Howard about the constructive relationship with Public Health,” added Dirk Draper, CEO of the Chamber & EDC. “We have been meeting for last three weeks with Public Health, and fostering a collaborative cross-industry effort where we’ve gotten to share perspectives from business organizations and industries. We appreciate the open lines of communication with Public Health.” Public Health will continue to assess the local environment and the data and make changes as needed. With this in mind, the requirements set forth above may require revision as Public Health learns more from ongoing COVID-19 data produced by changes in restrictions. Allowing people to gather in a closed space over time carries inherent risk that must be acknowledged by those choosing to participate, despite the protection inferred from the preventive measures above. “This is a perfect example of our community coming together and finding a compromise that moves the ball forward for our citizens and our businesses,” Commissioner Cami Bremer stated. “I believe this is where the community wants us to be: working together to get our economy and our way of life back on track.” Public Health remains dedicated to exploring innovative yet safe ways to gradually ease restrictions and help our community continue to thrive.
