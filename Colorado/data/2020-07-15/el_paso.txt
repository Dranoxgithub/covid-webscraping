	Click on an inspection score for details 

	  Retail food establishments are rated using a risk index system.  
  With a risk index system, the lower the final number, the better.  
  Violations are more heavily weighted when they pose a greater risk of foodborne illness.  
  For example, not rapidly reheating food to 165 °F (violation 19, which has a point value of 20) 
  would pose a greater risk to consumer’s health than a kitchen floor in disrepair (violation 55, which has a value 
of 0) 
At the time of inspection, the establishment had no serious priority or priority foundation violations associated with cooling, reheating, cooking, refrigeration and hot-holding equipment, cross-contamination between raw animal foods and ready-to-eat foods, employee hygiene, and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. Some less serious items may be in violation. The risk index range is 0-19 total points. 
  		At the time of inspection, the establishment could have one serious priority or priority foundation violation and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. Alternatively, the establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations. The risk index range is 20-39 total points.At the time of inspection, the establishment could have three serious priority or priority foundation violations and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. The establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations. The risk index range is 40-69 total points.At the time of inspection, the establishment could have four serious priority or priority foundation violations and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. The establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations. The risk index range is 70-99 total points.At the time of inspection, the establishment could have more than five serious priority or priority foundation violations and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. The establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations.

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessA Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) is a long-term, systematic effort to address issues identified by the Community Health Assessment (CHA). A strong CHIP can be used by other agencies in the community to identify local community health needs and priorities. El Paso County Public Health and all public health agencies in Colorado are required by Senate Bill 194 to complete a CHIP for the community each serves. El Paso County Public Health is also required to complete a CHIP every five years by the Public Health Accreditation Board. Non-profit hospitals also are required to create a similar plan as a part of the Affordable Care Act.In order to facilitate this process and produce a CHIP that works for Public Health and hospitals, El Paso County Public Health convenes a stakeholder group called the Healthy Community Collaborative. This group has been meeting regularly since 2011. The Healthy Community Collaborative consists of representatives from Public Health, area hospitals, medical providers, social service agencies, schools, the for-profit and non-profit business communities, academia, and individual citizens.The Healthy Community Collaborative has reviewed the health indicator and socioeconomic data for the 2017 CHA and is in the process of creating a written CHIP report for 2018-2022. The Healthy Community Collaborative has selected two priority areas for the CHIP: mental health/substance use and healthy eating/active living. The Health Community Collaborative is beginning to monitor its progress on the CHIP's priority areas on the Thriving Colorado dashboard, which can be found

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessWe help protect you from foodborne illness by inspecting retail food establishments, providing education about proper food handling, and food product recalls.We prevent foodborne illness in El Paso County's retail food establishments through regulatory and educational efforts. El Paso County has more than 2,700 licensed establishments or vendors that provide food to the public — including restaurants, caterers, grocery stores, convenience stores, school kitchens, and mobile vehicle vendors. Public Health’s Environmental Health Specialists routinely inspect facilities to assure compliance with food safety regulations and educate food handlers, investigate consumer complaints, and assist with foodborne outbreak investigations. In addition, Public Health issues licenses to retail food establishments and conducts thorough reviews of plans for new and remodeled facilities.

 for information on safely storing and preparing food at home, food recalls, food poisoning and more.In 2012, the Colorado Legislature enacted Senate Bill 12-048 allowing individuals to produce, sell and store certain types of “cottage food” products in an unlicensed home kitchen. Cottage food products include such items as spices, teas, dehydrated produce, nuts, seeds, honey, candies, jams, jellies and certain non-potentially hazardous baked goods. Cottage food operations are subject to the requirements of Senate Bill 12-048, but require no license or permit from El Paso County Public Health or from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and are not inspected by any state or local government entity. The Food Safety Advisory Group (FSAG) was organized to allow for information sharing between public health and industry; will serve as an avenue for organizing local food safety training, providing input on proposed policy, assuring consistency in regulation interpretation by Public Health, and will work together to continue to improve the Food Safety Program.

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessThe El Paso County Health Indicators 2017 Report, also referred to as the Community Health Assessment, provides a comprehensive look at the overall health status of our community. This report represents many months of careful and systematic review of data that tells the story about the health of people in our community. The information updates our residents about health issues that cause illness, injury, loss of quality of life, and death in El Paso County. El Paso County Public Health collected and analyzed data to assess the county's "health" using indicators that align with Colorado 10 Winnable Battles.El Paso County Public Health acknowledges that generations-long social, economic, and environmental inequities result in adverse health outcomes. They affect communities differently and have a greater influence on health outcomes than either individual choices or one's ability to access health care. The report also provides demographic and socioeconomic data about El Paso County and seeks to add context about how systems such as the built environment, access to health care, and the social determinants of health impact the health data. Some examples of the social determinants of health include: the safety of workplaces, the cleanliness of air and water, access to quality, affordable child care, access to healthy food choices, and access to safe spaces for physical activity. For questions or comments, contact us at

The HCC consists of over 
60 representatives
 from schools, hospitals and health systems, non-profit organizations, city and county government agencies, public health, medical providers, and interested citizens. Between 2012 and 2017, the HCC worked together to implement activities and proven strategies within partner agencies to address health eating and active living to improve the health of the people of El Paso County. Efforts included activities to increase healthy food options for both adults and children in settings such as schools, worksites, and neighborhoods; to increase opportunities for physical activity; and to promote other behaviors and policies that reduce risk for obesity.In 2017, the HCC updated its priorities and refreshed its goal statement after reviewing the health, socioeconomic, demographic, and health equity data presented during the Community Health Assessment process.The vision of the HCC is to increase life expectancy for all in El Paso County by removing barriers that prevent people from achieving optimal health. The HCC will achieve this vision by building an integrated system of community partnerships which puts practices into place that provide people the opportunity to have better health outcomes.

We are committed to collaborating with community members from a wide range of disciplines to support our youth initiatives. Our efforts are focused on prevention, policy, and systems change.In June 2016, Public Health convened community leaders from cities and towns across El Paso County to discuss concerns facing our youth, and to prioritize their commitment for youth advocacy work. The group chose teen suicide prevention and youth substance use as the top two issues. Public Health youth health initiative focus areas:​Now more than ever, it is important that we listen and learn from our youth. We are partnering with local agencies to promote the implementation of the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey in El Paso County. The Healthy Kids Colorado Survey will allow youth-serving organizations across the county to better understand the unique health climate surrounding youth.

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessWe inspect and regulate on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS), also known as septic systems. We protect public health and the environment by preventing human exposure to sewage and the contamination of our groundwater by ensuring the proper placement, design, installation, and maintenance of OWTS. We focus on regulation of wastewater treatment systems associated with both commercial and residential facilities that are not serviced by a municipal wastewater system. There are an estimated 30,000 operating OWTS in El Paso County.El Paso County Public Health has launched a new service that gives people access to septic system records online.The information is available on the
 El Paso County Assessor's 'Public Records Real Estate Property Search' site
 at 
https://property.spatialest.com/co/elpaso/
. This allows septic permit and as-built information to be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a weekNot all parcels or properties have complete septic system records on file. If the septic system record cannot be found online, call (719) 578-3199 and select option 3 or email 
HEAsepticinfo@elpasoco.com
 for assistance.The On-Site Wastewater Treatment Systems' Technical Advisory Group meets quarterly to discuss on-site wastewater policy, current science, technology, and trends. Meetings are held at the Public Health offices in the Citizens Service Center located at 1675 W. Garden of the Gods Road. For more information, contact Kat McGarvy, Program Manager (719) 578-3112 or by email at

 Septic systems are usually not considered an essential part of a home. But replacing a residential septic treatment system may cost between $8,000 and $15,000!  Periodic inspection and timely repair of your system components can prevent damage to the soil and water in the ground around your home, and may extend the useful life of your system.Certified Operation and Maintenance 
SpecialistThe new El Paso County Board of Health Regulations, Chapter 8, were approved by the Board of Health on February 24, 2014. Section 8.4.O, Transfer of Title, on page 24, was also approved and has an effective date of January 1, 2015.Our program goal is to help assure that the OWTS is inspected properly by a Public Health Certified OWTS Inspector, and all system components being maintained and operated as designed.  Results of the inspections will be made available to the real estate industry quickly through a website dedicated for the Certified OWTS Inspector to record all OWTS inspection results.  The results would then be easily accessed and available for those involved in the property transaction.Assurance that OWTS are maintained and operating as designed is a vital part of protecting groundwater and surface water quality, as well as the health of the public.(719) 578-3199

	Click on an inspection score for details 

	  Retail food establishments are rated using a risk index system.  
  With a risk index system, the lower the final number, the better.  
  Violations are more heavily weighted when they pose a greater risk of foodborne illness.  
  For example, not rapidly reheating food to 165 °F (violation 19, which has a point value of 20) 
  would pose a greater risk to consumer’s health than a kitchen floor in disrepair (violation 55, which has a value 
of 0) 
At the time of inspection, the establishment had no serious priority or priority foundation violations associated with cooling, reheating, cooking, refrigeration and hot-holding equipment, cross-contamination between raw animal foods and ready-to-eat foods, employee hygiene, and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. Some less serious items may be in violation. The risk index range is 0-19 total points. 
  		At the time of inspection, the establishment could have one serious priority or priority foundation violation and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. Alternatively, the establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations. The risk index range is 20-39 total points.At the time of inspection, the establishment could have three serious priority or priority foundation violations and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. The establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations. The risk index range is 40-69 total points.At the time of inspection, the establishment could have four serious priority or priority foundation violations and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. The establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations. The risk index range is 70-99 total points.At the time of inspection, the establishment could have more than five serious priority or priority foundation violations and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. The establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations.

Scraping from https://www.elpasocountyhealth.org/services/radon


Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessRadon is an invisible, odorless, tasteless, radioactive gas. It comes from the natural breakdown of uranium found in soils, rock, and water. Because radon is odorless and invisible, the only way to know if your home has a radon problem is to test.Radon seeps through the soil, and moves into the air and into homes through cracks and small openings in foundations. Homes trap radon in living spaces, where it may build up to dangerous levels.Over half of all the homes tested between 2011-2015 had high levels of radon. Radon levels vary greatly from home to home. El Paso County and the state of Colorado are in "Zone 1" according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This means the state and county have a potential for high radon levels.We encourage people to check the radon levels in their homes. The American Lung Association recommends that all homes be tested for radon. The U.S. Surgeon General warns that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the nation.If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.Radon testing is now available from the 
Colorado Springs Radon Measurement Lab

 Other options for radon testing:The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has information about discounted test kits 
available here
 , or reach out to the Colorado Springs Radon Measurement Lab at 719-575-8484 for information about purchasing a radon test kit.Buy a test kit online or at a local home improvement store. Be sure the kit says "certified by the National Radon Proficiency Program." When used properly, these kits provide results as accurate as those done by a contractor.Radon reduction systems can reduce radon levels by up to 99 percent. Radon reduction systems require knowledge and special skills to design. Hire a contractor who is specifically trained in radon reduction.You can contact the Colorado Radon Office at (800) 846-3986 for names of qualified or state certified contractors. You can also access Colorado Department of Public Health's information of certified contractors 
here
.There are several proven ways to reduce radon in your home. The vent pipe system and fan is the most used. This method pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside. A mitigation system in Colorado usually costs about $800-$1,200 unless difficult design problems are encountered.Radon contractors can use other methods that may also work in your home. The right system depends on the design of your home and other factors. New homes can be built with radon reduction features. Installing these at the time of construction is easier and less expensive than modifying older homes.If you are buying or selling a home, the buyer may request radon test results. If you are selling a home, and you know the home has radon, or had radon in the past, you must provide this information in the 
Colorado Seller's Property Disclosure 
form.If you are a renter, you can find out if the building you live in has been tested for radon. If your building has not been tested for radon, ask the owner to test, or test your own apartment or house.If your test shows high radon levels, notify the building owner of the test results. Discuss the need for additional testing and repairs.Landlords in Colorado are not required to test for radon or to mitigate for high radon levels. (719) 578-3199

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessDirectly Observed Therapy (DOT) is the gold standard for TB treatment because it ensures treatment and completion and prevents the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of TB. DOT involves having a health care provider watch a patient swallow all of their TB medication. This is typically done in-person at the patient's home. It is highly effective, but with most treatment requiring a minimum of three months for latent TB infection and a minimum of six months for active TB disease, DOT requires a significant commitment of resources and time for both the patient and they county TB program.Widespread ownership of smartphones enabled use of technology to allow patients to submit videos of their treatment. El Paso County Public Health first implemented video-recorded DOT in 2017 and drastically reduced the time and cost associated with TB treatment. However, treatment via video requires strict adherence to quality standards such as keeping hands within the video frame, showing pills to the camera, and making it clear that the pills have been swallowed. Many patients struggled to produce videos that met the quality standards for treatment verification. El Paso County Public Health has developed this video DOT tool kit to aid patients in producing daily, high-quality video recordings that clearly show them taking their TB medications while being able to remain in their homes while also allowing their health care providers to assure medication adherence. After acquiring the appropriate LEGO bricks (see the Resource tab), the simple phone holder can be assembled according to the pattern shown:  Print out all three pages of the DOT mat template (see the Resource tab) and align them to create a single 11 x 24 inch mat. Either affix the templates to sturdy cardboard or use clear packing tape to add strength and durability to the mat.Choose a consistent location for video DOT to simplify daily setup and tear down. Have the patient sit in a chair facing a flat table with the assembled DOT mat in front of them, with the medication and water indicators on the side closest to the patient and the mat aligned with the edge of the table.Place the phone in the phone holder with the camera function on in selfie mode. Adjust the position of the phone holder and the angle of the phone in the holder so that the patient's face and DOT mat are in view. Assure that the medication and water indicators are in view. Trace the location of the phone holder in permanent ink onto the DOT mat.Instruct the patient to assemble the video DOT setup the same way each day to ensure usable videos. The placement of the phone in the holder is especially important.Click here to print the DOT mat
. The mat can be assembled using basic office supplies as per the instructions in the Assembly and Use tab.The phone holder is assembled from LEGO bricks (although other commercially available construction bricks will work.) Bricks are currently available for purchase from the LEGO "pick a brick" website: 
https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Pick-a-BrickThe necessary bricks for the construction as shown are:These are available in a variety of fun and aesthetically pleasing colors. With 4-8 day shipping, the cost of one phone assembly is currently $6.67(719) 578-3199

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessEl Paso County Public Health Laboratory performs water potability testing for private well owners and for community water systems required to meet Colorado Primary Drinking Water Regulations. Water from private wells is not monitored for quality by government agencies. Wells are directly linked to groundwater and they can become contaminated if agricultural chemicals, runoff from animal enclosures, fuels, household wastes, or other contaminants accidentally enter them. It is the responsibility of the homeowner who owns a private well to periodically test their well for contamination. Water testing helps ensure that your drinking water is safe.EPCPH Laboratory does not provide water collection services. Real estate agents, homeowners or buyers can collect and deliver the water sample using our water collection kit.

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessColorado Springs Fire Chief Ted Collas honors the work of public and community health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. This editorial appeared in the Colorado Springs Gazette on June 24, 2020.Since early April, the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce & Economic Development Corporation and El Paso County Public Health have been working together to balance public health concerns with economic health concerns in our community. Together, we developed the "We're Staying Safe" signs for businesses to post to notify customers that they are complying with state and local health guidelines. Look for these signs when you enter businesses — they let you know which businesses are working to keep you safe. You can also help your favorite businesses thrive by following health guidelines yourself. This editorial appeared in the Colorado Springs Gazette on June 21, 2020.In 2003, my 3-year-old daughter became very ill. What followed was six months of self-imposed quarantine, financial troubles and nearly losing my child. I know that many of you think that those in the public health field can't possibly understand how difficult all the changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have been for you. I assure you, I do understand. The Safer at Home phase didn't just happen; it's the result of the hard work and sacrifices we have all made to flatten the curve. While, we're on the right path, doctors and scientists are still working to answer important questions about COVID-19. Your continued patience and cooperation will help us to move out of this pandemic without risking all our gains.Dr. Charles Benight, a professor of psychology at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and the head of the new UCCS National Institute for Human Resilience, founded GRIT after a career focused on disaster and trauma recovery. Dr. Benight explains that GRIT takes advantage of our greatest mental health resource: each other. By building off existing bonds between friends, coworkers and family members, the program fosters strength and resilience in the face of adversity.The creation of a single, regional office of emergency management, the Pikes Peak Regional Office of Emergency Management, created efficiencies of time, staff and taxpayer dollars and led to a more organized response to the COVID-19 pandemic.We have a lot of promising information and great minds working to move our understanding forward, but we have to be patient and make decisions based on complete data. We don’t want people to feel a false sense of security due to antibody testing. We do not yet fully understand what these tests mean in terms of immunity.As we move from the Governor’s “Stay At Home” to “Safer At Home” this week, it’s good to reflect back on where we are and how far we’ve come already with our response to COVID-19 here in El Paso County. It's also important that we all continue to do our part to combat this virus!As we all look forward to leading more normal lives, we must do everything we can to increase testing. Testing sick people will help us ensure the safety of the public and arm us with the information we need to effectively fight COVID-19.Dr. Robin Johnson, Medical Director of El Paso County Public Health, discusses how vaccinations have changed the course of human history. We are now witnessing the terrible toll a virus can take when we don't have the right tools to fight it. Thankfully, doctors and scientists are working to develop a vaccine for COVID-19.(719) 578-3199

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessWe inspect and regulate on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS), also known as septic systems. We protect public health and the environment by preventing human exposure to sewage and the contamination of our groundwater by ensuring the proper placement, design, installation, and maintenance of OWTS. We focus on regulation of wastewater treatment systems associated with both commercial and residential facilities that are not serviced by a municipal wastewater system. There are an estimated 30,000 operating OWTS in El Paso County.El Paso County Public Health has launched a new service that gives people access to septic system records online.The information is available on the
 El Paso County Assessor's 'Public Records Real Estate Property Search' site

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessOn June 30, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced the final roadmap for the 
Protect Our Neighbors 
phase. This means communities that meet certain criteria have less stringent restrictions, and may permit activities at 50 percent of pre-pandemic capacity, with at least six feet between non-household members, and no more than 500 people in one setting at a time. Communities that can demonstrate strong public health and health care systems -- paired with low virus levels -- will be able to take on more control over their own reopening plans. Strong local public health and health care systems are the key to reopening the economy. Different communities will be at different phases, based on local conditions and capabilities. No, this phase is not currently in effect. Local counties and regions will need to take several steps to qualify.                            Counties must qualify by meeting scientifically established thresholds of:In addition, communities must have mitigation and containment plans approved by local elected leaders including county commissioners and mayors, the hospitals that serve the county, law enforcement, emergency management, the local public health director, and if applicable, tribes. (719) 578-3199

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessColorado Springs Fire Chief Ted Collas honors the work of public and community health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. This editorial appeared in the Colorado Springs Gazette on June 24, 2020.Since early April, the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce & Economic Development Corporation and El Paso County Public Health have been working together to balance public health concerns with economic health concerns in our community. Together, we developed the "We're Staying Safe" signs for businesses to post to notify customers that they are complying with state and local health guidelines. Look for these signs when you enter businesses — they let you know which businesses are working to keep you safe. You can also help your favorite businesses thrive by following health guidelines yourself. This editorial appeared in the Colorado Springs Gazette on June 21, 2020.In 2003, my 3-year-old daughter became very ill. What followed was six months of self-imposed quarantine, financial troubles and nearly losing my child. I know that many of you think that those in the public health field can't possibly understand how difficult all the changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have been for you. I assure you, I do understand. The Safer at Home phase didn't just happen; it's the result of the hard work and sacrifices we have all made to flatten the curve. While, we're on the right path, doctors and scientists are still working to answer important questions about COVID-19. Your continued patience and cooperation will help us to move out of this pandemic without risking all our gains.Dr. Charles Benight, a professor of psychology at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and the head of the new UCCS National Institute for Human Resilience, founded GRIT after a career focused on disaster and trauma recovery. Dr. Benight explains that GRIT takes advantage of our greatest mental health resource: each other. By building off existing bonds between friends, coworkers and family members, the program fosters strength and resilience in the face of adversity.The creation of a single, regional office of emergency management, the Pikes Peak Regional Office of Emergency Management, created efficiencies of time, staff and taxpayer dollars and led to a more organized response to the COVID-19 pandemic.We have a lot of promising information and great minds working to move our understanding forward, but we have to be patient and make decisions based on complete data. We don’t want people to feel a false sense of security due to antibody testing. We do not yet fully understand what these tests mean in terms of immunity.As we move from the Governor’s “Stay At Home” to “Safer At Home” this week, it’s good to reflect back on where we are and how far we’ve come already with our response to COVID-19 here in El Paso County. It's also important that we all continue to do our part to combat this virus!As we all look forward to leading more normal lives, we must do everything we can to increase testing. Testing sick people will help us ensure the safety of the public and arm us with the information we need to effectively fight COVID-19.Dr. Robin Johnson, Medical Director of El Paso County Public Health, discusses how vaccinations have changed the course of human history. We are now witnessing the terrible toll a virus can take when we don't have the right tools to fight it. Thankfully, doctors and scientists are working to develop a vaccine for COVID-19.(719) 578-3199

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessThe CDC continues to study the spread and effects of COVID-19 across the United States. It is now known that a significant portion of individuals with COVID-19 lack symptoms. These asymptomatic individuals, along with individuals who will eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”), can transmit the virus to others. This means that the virus can be spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.
The 
CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings
 in public settings where other physical distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
 It is important to remember that maintaining 6-feet physical distancing remains critical in slowing the spread of COVID-19. The use of face coverings does not replace previous physical distancing recommendations.
Surgical masks or N-95 respirators are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. These critical supplies are not recommended for use by the general public. 
Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance.
Cloth face coverings should:Avoid using face coverings that are not cotton or woven fabric as they are not recommended to provide protection.
Usage and care of cloth face coverings:Tips to follow whenever you need to leave your home:If you would like to sew masks to donate for El Paso County first responders, please follow the guidance below:(719) 578-3199

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessThinking about COVID-19 can be overwhelming. If you or your loved ones are feeling anxious, worried, angry, or helpless, you are not alone. Here are some healthy ways to address those feelings:
Limit the news.
 Regulate the amount of time you spend watching or reading about the situation. Look to reliable sources for information:Take care of yourself.
 Make sure you get enough rest and exercise.
Do things you enjoy.
 Read a book, watch movies or TV shows that you have meant to catch up on, learn to cook something new, or do some spring cleaning. Use the web to find online activities (some examples include 
Fine Arts Center
, 
Metropolitan Opera
 and the 
Pikes Peak Library District
).
Take control.
  There are many actions you can take in your 
daily life to cope with stress
, including preparing your household, protecting yourself while running errands and caring for children and pets.
Avoid making assumptions.
 Someone coughing or sneezing does not necessarily have COVID-19. Maintain the required physical distance of six feet and remain empathetic to those around you.
Stay Connected.  
Use virtual resources (such as FaceTime, Zoom, WhatsApp) to connect with friends and family on a regular basis. 
Volunteer.  
If you are healthy, consider volunteering your time to support organizations that are considered critical businesses. Some have opportunities to volunteer from home.  A list of local and immediate needs can be found 
here.A full list of resources can be found on

The mission of Pikes Peak Regional Office of Emergency Management is to build resilience for the whole community through risk reduction, education, emergency coordination, and disaster recovery.“Delivering Exemplary Emergency Management Services Essential to the Region”The Pikes Peak Regional Office of Emergency Management (PPROEM) provides coordination and support for activities relating to disaster prevention, preparedness, response and recovery to protect the lives of the citizens in our community, and is directed jointly by the El Paso County Board of Commissioners and the City of Colorado Springs.Readiness

Preparation for emergencies considers all potential hazards, natural or human-caused. Our planning process anticipates future disasters and develops a cooperative process to prevent and mitigate hazards, and organizes local actions when a disaster occurs. Training and exercise activities promote collaboration among all levels of government and local organizations to help unite our community and strengthen our abilities to serve the community.Response

The Emergency Coordination Center (ECC) is a core resource that supports disaster response operations in the region. It is a central coordination point for all emergency support functions, communication, and public information in a disaster. The ECC is also a hub for incident accountability, recordkeeping, reporting, and financial functions for large-scale emergencies.Recovery

Mitigating the impact of a disaster and coordinating efforts to restore the community is another primary focus of the PPROEM. Recovery is the longest phase of a disaster. It includes the rapid restoration of public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and drainages to a useable condition. Then, long-term reconstruction work builds in resiliency to allow the infrastructure to withstand other disasters.Hazardous Materials

PPROEM is the Designated Emergency Response Authority (DERA) for unincorporated El Paso County. The DERA is responsible for Hazardous Materials response, training, incident planning and reporting. This includes monitoring Tier II reporting by facilities using hazardous materials and participation in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with local industry and community stakeholders.James A.

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessA Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) is a long-term, systematic effort to address issues identified by the Community Health Assessment (CHA). A strong CHIP can be used by other agencies in the community to identify local community health needs and priorities. El Paso County Public Health and all public health agencies in Colorado are required by Senate Bill 194 to complete a CHIP for the community each serves. El Paso County Public Health is also required to complete a CHIP every five years by the Public Health Accreditation Board. Non-profit hospitals also are required to create a similar plan as a part of the Affordable Care Act.In order to facilitate this process and produce a CHIP that works for Public Health and hospitals, El Paso County Public Health convenes a stakeholder group called the Healthy Community Collaborative. This group has been meeting regularly since 2011. The Healthy Community Collaborative consists of representatives from Public Health, area hospitals, medical providers, social service agencies, schools, the for-profit and non-profit business communities, academia, and individual citizens.The Healthy Community Collaborative has reviewed the health indicator and socioeconomic data for the 2017 CHA and is in the process of creating a written CHIP report for 2018-2022. The Healthy Community Collaborative has selected two priority areas for the CHIP: mental health/substance use and healthy eating/active living. The Health Community Collaborative is beginning to monitor its progress on the CHIP's priority areas on the Thriving Colorado dashboard, which can be found

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessWe help protect you from foodborne illness by inspecting retail food establishments, providing education about proper food handling, and food product recalls.We prevent foodborne illness in El Paso County's retail food establishments through regulatory and educational efforts. El Paso County has more than 2,700 licensed establishments or vendors that provide food to the public — including restaurants, caterers, grocery stores, convenience stores, school kitchens, and mobile vehicle vendors. Public Health’s Environmental Health Specialists routinely inspect facilities to assure compliance with food safety regulations and educate food handlers, investigate consumer complaints, and assist with foodborne outbreak investigations. In addition, Public Health issues licenses to retail food establishments and conducts thorough reviews of plans for new and remodeled facilities.

 for information on safely storing and preparing food at home, food recalls, food poisoning and more.In 2012, the Colorado Legislature enacted Senate Bill 12-048 allowing individuals to produce, sell and store certain types of “cottage food” products in an unlicensed home kitchen. Cottage food products include such items as spices, teas, dehydrated produce, nuts, seeds, honey, candies, jams, jellies and certain non-potentially hazardous baked goods. Cottage food operations are subject to the requirements of Senate Bill 12-048, but require no license or permit from El Paso County Public Health or from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and are not inspected by any state or local government entity. The Food Safety Advisory Group (FSAG) was organized to allow for information sharing between public health and industry; will serve as an avenue for organizing local food safety training, providing input on proposed policy, assuring consistency in regulation interpretation by Public Health, and will work together to continue to improve the Food Safety Program.

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessThe El Paso County Health Indicators 2017 Report, also referred to as the Community Health Assessment, provides a comprehensive look at the overall health status of our community. This report represents many months of careful and systematic review of data that tells the story about the health of people in our community. The information updates our residents about health issues that cause illness, injury, loss of quality of life, and death in El Paso County. El Paso County Public Health collected and analyzed data to assess the county's "health" using indicators that align with Colorado 10 Winnable Battles.El Paso County Public Health acknowledges that generations-long social, economic, and environmental inequities result in adverse health outcomes. They affect communities differently and have a greater influence on health outcomes than either individual choices or one's ability to access health care. The report also provides demographic and socioeconomic data about El Paso County and seeks to add context about how systems such as the built environment, access to health care, and the social determinants of health impact the health data. Some examples of the social determinants of health include: the safety of workplaces, the cleanliness of air and water, access to quality, affordable child care, access to healthy food choices, and access to safe spaces for physical activity. For questions or comments, contact us at

Efforts included activities to increase healthy food options for both adults and children in settings such as schools, worksites, and neighborhoods; to increase opportunities for physical activity; and to promote other behaviors and policies that reduce risk for obesity.In 2017, the HCC updated its priorities and refreshed its goal statement after reviewing the health, socioeconomic, demographic, and health equity data presented during the Community Health Assessment process.The vision of the HCC is to increase life expectancy for all in El Paso County by removing barriers that prevent people from achieving optimal health. The HCC will achieve this vision by building an integrated system of community partnerships which puts practices into place that provide people the opportunity to have better health outcomes.

We are committed to collaborating with community members from a wide range of disciplines to support our youth initiatives. Our efforts are focused on prevention, policy, and systems change.In June 2016, Public Health convened community leaders from cities and towns across El Paso County to discuss concerns facing our youth, and to prioritize their commitment for youth advocacy work.

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessWe inspect and regulate on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS), also known as septic systems. We protect public health and the environment by preventing human exposure to sewage and the contamination of our groundwater by ensuring the proper placement, design, installation, and maintenance of OWTS. We focus on regulation of wastewater treatment systems associated with both commercial and residential facilities that are not serviced by a municipal wastewater system. There are an estimated 30,000 operating OWTS in El Paso County.El Paso County Public Health has launched a new service that gives people access to septic system records online.The information is available on the
 El Paso County Assessor's 'Public Records Real Estate Property Search' site
 at 
https://property.spatialest.com/co/elpaso/
. This allows septic permit and as-built information to be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a weekNot all parcels or properties have complete septic system records on file. If the septic system record cannot be found online, call (719) 578-3199 and select option 3 or email 
HEAsepticinfo@elpasoco.com
 for assistance.The On-Site Wastewater Treatment Systems' Technical Advisory Group meets quarterly to discuss on-site wastewater policy, current science, technology, and trends. Meetings are held at the Public Health offices in the Citizens Service Center located at 1675 W. Garden of the Gods Road. For more information, contact Kat McGarvy, Program Manager (719) 578-3112 or by email at 
catherinemcgarvy@elpasoco.com
 Septic systems are usually not considered an essential part of a home. But replacing a residential septic treatment system may cost between $8,000 and $15,000!  Periodic inspection and timely repair of your system components can prevent damage to the soil and water in the ground around your home, and may extend the useful life of your system.Certified Operation and Maintenance 
SpecialistThe new El Paso County Board of Health Regulations, Chapter 8, were approved by the Board of Health on February 24, 2014. Section 8.4.O, Transfer of Title, on page 24, was also approved and has an effective date of January 1, 2015.Our program goal is to help assure that the OWTS is inspected properly by a Public Health Certified OWTS Inspector, and all system components being maintained and operated as designed.  Results of the inspections will be made available to the real estate industry quickly through a website dedicated for the Certified OWTS Inspector to record all OWTS inspection results.  The results would then be easily accessed and available for those involved in the property transaction.Assurance that OWTS are maintained and operating as designed is a vital part of protecting groundwater and surface water quality, as well as the health of the public.(719) 578-3199

	Click on an inspection score for details 

	  Retail food establishments are rated using a risk index system.  
  With a risk index system, the lower the final number, the better.  
  Violations are more heavily weighted when they pose a greater risk of foodborne illness.  
  For example, not rapidly reheating food to 165 °F (violation 19, which has a point value of 20) 
  would pose a greater risk to consumer’s health than a kitchen floor in disrepair (violation 55, which has a value 
of 0) 
At the time of inspection, the establishment had no serious priority or priority foundation violations associated with cooling, reheating, cooking, refrigeration and hot-holding equipment, cross-contamination between raw animal foods and ready-to-eat foods, employee hygiene, and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. Some less serious items may be in violation. The risk index range is 0-19 total points. 
  		At the time of inspection, the establishment could have one serious priority or priority foundation violation and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. Alternatively, the establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations. The risk index range is 20-39 total points.At the time of inspection, the establishment could have three serious priority or priority foundation violations and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. The establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations. The risk index range is 40-69 total points.At the time of inspection, the establishment could have four serious priority or priority foundation violations and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. The establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations. The risk index range is 70-99 total points.At the time of inspection, the establishment could have more than five serious priority or priority foundation violations and other items with risk index values of 20 or more points. The establishment could have one or more secondary violations with risk index values of 5 to 15 points, as well as some core violations.

Scraping from https://www.elpasocountyhealth.org/services/radon


Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessRadon is an invisible, odorless, tasteless, radioactive gas. It comes from the natural breakdown of uranium found in soils, rock, and water. Because radon is odorless and invisible, the only way to know if your home has a radon problem is to test.Radon seeps through the soil, and moves into the air and into homes through cracks and small openings in foundations. Homes trap radon in living spaces, where it may build up to dangerous levels.Over half of all the homes tested between 2011-2015 had high levels of radon. Radon levels vary greatly from home to home. El Paso County and the state of Colorado are in "Zone 1" according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This means the state and county have a potential for high radon levels.We encourage people to check the radon levels in their homes. The American Lung Association recommends that all homes be tested for radon. The U.S. Surgeon General warns that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the nation.If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.Radon testing is now available from the 
Colorado Springs Radon Measurement Lab
, located at El Paso County Public Health.Hours of operation: 
7:30-a.m. – 4:30 p.m.Phone number:
 (719) 575-8484Email:

 Other options for radon testing:The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has information about discounted test kits 
available here
 , or reach out to the Colorado Springs Radon Measurement Lab at 719-575-8484 for information about purchasing a radon test kit.Buy a test kit online or at a local home improvement store. Be sure the kit says "certified by the National Radon Proficiency Program." When used properly, these kits provide results as accurate as those done by a contractor.Radon reduction systems can reduce radon levels by up to 99 percent. Radon reduction systems require knowledge and special skills to design. Hire a contractor who is specifically trained in radon reduction.You can contact the Colorado Radon Office at (800) 846-3986 for names of qualified or state certified contractors. You can also access Colorado Department of Public Health's information of certified contractors 
here
.There are several proven ways to reduce radon in your home. The vent pipe system and fan is the most used. This method pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside. A mitigation system in Colorado usually costs about $800-$1,200 unless difficult design problems are encountered.Radon contractors can use other methods that may also work in your home. The right system depends on the design of your home and other factors. New homes can be built with radon reduction features. Installing these at the time of construction is easier and less expensive than modifying older homes.If you are buying or selling a home, the buyer may request radon test results. If you are selling a home, and you know the home has radon, or had radon in the past, you must provide this information in the 
Colorado Seller's Property Disclosure 
form.If you are a renter, you can find out if the building you live in has been tested for radon. If your building has not been tested for radon, ask the owner to test, or test your own apartment or house.If your test shows high radon levels, notify the building owner of the test results. Discuss the need for additional testing and repairs.Landlords in Colorado are not required to test for radon or to mitigate for high radon levels. (719) 578-3199

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessDirectly Observed Therapy (DOT) is the gold standard for TB treatment because it ensures treatment and completion and prevents the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of TB. DOT involves having a health care provider watch a patient swallow all of their TB medication. This is typically done in-person at the patient's home. It is highly effective, but with most treatment requiring a minimum of three months for latent TB infection and a minimum of six months for active TB disease, DOT requires a significant commitment of resources and time for both the patient and they county TB program.Widespread ownership of smartphones enabled use of technology to allow patients to submit videos of their treatment. El Paso County Public Health first implemented video-recorded DOT in 2017 and drastically reduced the time and cost associated with TB treatment. However, treatment via video requires strict adherence to quality standards such as keeping hands within the video frame, showing pills to the camera, and making it clear that the pills have been swallowed. Many patients struggled to produce videos that met the quality standards for treatment verification. El Paso County Public Health has developed this video DOT tool kit to aid patients in producing daily, high-quality video recordings that clearly show them taking their TB medications while being able to remain in their homes while also allowing their health care providers to assure medication adherence. After acquiring the appropriate LEGO bricks (see the Resource tab), the simple phone holder can be assembled according to the pattern shown:  Print out all three pages of the DOT mat template (see the Resource tab) and align them to create a single 11 x 24 inch mat. Either affix the templates to sturdy cardboard or use clear packing tape to add strength and durability to the mat.Choose a consistent location for video DOT to simplify daily setup and tear down. Have the patient sit in a chair facing a flat table with the assembled DOT mat in front of them, with the medication and water indicators on the side closest to the patient and the mat aligned with the edge of the table.Place the phone in the phone holder with the camera function on in selfie mode. Adjust the position of the phone holder and the angle of the phone in the holder so that the patient's face and DOT mat are in view. Assure that the medication and water indicators are in view. Trace the location of the phone holder in permanent ink onto the DOT mat.Instruct the patient to assemble the video DOT setup the same way each day to ensure usable videos. The placement of the phone in the holder is especially important.Click here to print the DOT mat
. The mat can be assembled using basic office supplies as per the instructions in the Assembly and Use tab.The phone holder is assembled from LEGO bricks (although other commercially available construction bricks will work.) Bricks are currently available for purchase from the LEGO "pick a brick" website: 
https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Pick-a-BrickThe necessary bricks for the construction as shown are:These are available in a variety of fun and aesthetically pleasing colors. With 4-8 day shipping, the cost of one phone assembly is currently $6.67(719) 578-3199

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessEl Paso County Public Health Laboratory performs water potability testing for private well owners and for community water systems required to meet Colorado Primary Drinking Water Regulations. Water from private wells is not monitored for quality by government agencies. Wells are directly linked to groundwater and they can become contaminated if agricultural chemicals, runoff from animal enclosures, fuels, household wastes, or other contaminants accidentally enter them. It is the responsibility of the homeowner who owns a private well to periodically test their well for contamination. Water testing helps ensure that your drinking water is safe.EPCPH Laboratory does not provide water collection services. Real estate agents, homeowners or buyers can collect and deliver the water sample using our water collection kit. In a real estate transaction it is the lender who determines what testing is required. Check with the lender if there are third party collection requirements. For more detailed information, visit the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's website

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessColorado Springs Fire Chief Ted Collas honors the work of public and community health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. This editorial appeared in the Colorado Springs Gazette on June 24, 2020.Since early April, the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce & Economic Development Corporation and El Paso County Public Health have been working together to balance public health concerns with economic health concerns in our community. Together, we developed the "We're Staying Safe" signs for businesses to post to notify customers that they are complying with state and local health guidelines. Look for these signs when you enter businesses — they let you know which businesses are working to keep you safe. You can also help your favorite businesses thrive by following health guidelines yourself. This editorial appeared in the Colorado Springs Gazette on June 21, 2020.In 2003, my 3-year-old daughter became very ill. What followed was six months of self-imposed quarantine, financial troubles and nearly losing my child. I know that many of you think that those in the public health field can't possibly understand how difficult all the changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have been for you. I assure you, I do understand. The Safer at Home phase didn't just happen; it's the result of the hard work and sacrifices we have all made to flatten the curve. While, we're on the right path, doctors and scientists are still working to answer important questions about COVID-19. Your continued patience and cooperation will help us to move out of this pandemic without risking all our gains.Dr. Charles Benight, a professor of psychology at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and the head of the new UCCS National Institute for Human Resilience, founded GRIT after a career focused on disaster and trauma recovery. Dr. Benight explains that GRIT takes advantage of our greatest mental health resource: each other. By building off existing bonds between friends, coworkers and family members, the program fosters strength and resilience in the face of adversity.The creation of a single, regional office of emergency management, the Pikes Peak Regional Office of Emergency Management, created efficiencies of time, staff and taxpayer dollars and led to a more organized response to the COVID-19 pandemic.We have a lot of promising information and great minds working to move our understanding forward, but we have to be patient and make decisions based on complete data. We don’t want people to feel a false sense of security due to antibody testing. We do not yet fully understand what these tests mean in terms of immunity.As we move from the Governor’s “Stay At Home” to “Safer At Home” this week, it’s good to reflect back on where we are and how far we’ve come already with our response to COVID-19 here in El Paso County. It's also important that we all continue to do our part to combat this virus!As we all look forward to leading more normal lives, we must do everything we can to increase testing. Testing sick people will help us ensure the safety of the public and arm us with the information we need to effectively fight COVID-19.Dr. Robin Johnson, Medical Director of El Paso County Public Health, discusses how vaccinations have changed the course of human history. We are now witnessing the terrible toll a virus can take when we don't have the right tools to fight it. Thankfully, doctors and scientists are working to develop a vaccine for COVID-19.(719) 578-3199

Inspection ReportsReport A Public Health ConcernReport A Foodborne IllnessWe inspect and regulate on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS), also known as septic systems. We protect public health and the environment by preventing human exposure to sewage and the contamination of our groundwater by ensuring the proper placement, design, installation, and maintenance of OWTS. We focus on regulation of wastewater treatment systems associated with both commercial and residential facilities that are not serviced by a municipal wastewater system. There are an estimated 30,000 operating OWTS in El Paso County.El Paso County Public Health has launched a new service that gives people access to septic system records online.The information is available on the
 El Paso County Assessor's 'Public Records Real Estate Property Search' site
 at 
https://property.spatialest.com/co/elpaso/
. This allows septic permit and as-built information to be accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a weekNot all parcels or properties have complete septic system records on file. If the septic system record cannot be found online, call (719) 578-3199 and select option 3 or email 
HEAsepticinfo@elpasoco.com
 for assistance.The On-Site Wastewater Treatment Systems' Technical Advisory Group meets quarterly to discuss on-site wastewater policy, current science, technology, and trends. Meetings are held at the Public Health offices in the Citizens Service Center located at 1675 W.

 Septic systems are usually not considered an essential part of a home. But replacing a residential septic treatment system may cost between $8,000 and $15,000!  Periodic inspection and timely repair of your system components can prevent damage to the soil and water in the ground around your home, and may extend the useful life of your system.Certified Operation and Maintenance
