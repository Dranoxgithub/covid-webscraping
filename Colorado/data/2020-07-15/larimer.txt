Positive test results for COVID-19 are reported to the health department in a variety of ways for investigation and follow-up. Cases of COVID-19 are recorded as a case in the county where they permanently reside. 
Cases recorded here are Larimer County residents only.
 As we work through investigating cases originally assigned to and reported by Larimer County, they may be assigned to another county if we determine their permanent address is outside of the county.A case may be classified as confirmed, probable, or suspect depending on the characteristics of the person when diagnosed or how they were tested.Confirmed and probable cases are likely to be able to spread the virus at the time their test was done so these cases are investigated by public health to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19. At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Colorado, serologic testing was not available and a system to track probable cases that could not be tested due to limitations in available testing was not yet in place. Now that serologic testing and testing for active infections are now more available, suspect and probable cases are now being reported and tracked, sometimes retroactively, by public health officials. As we are receiving a larger volume of probable and suspect cases being reported to us, a trend that is likely to continue, LCDHE has added these differentiations to our case data. 
This page is being updated to reflect these different case types.
 Larimer County continues to do a good job flattening the curve. Compared to other large counties in the state, Larimer County continues to see noticeably lower COVID-19 cases and deaths.To protect the privacy of individuals, Larimer County will not publicly share any identifying information about COVID-19 cases. The most effective way to prevent COVID-19 is to stay home and avoid contact with everyone except for those in your household.**Probable deaths (possible connection to a COVID-19 case but testing was never completed) 
 CSVTwo or more lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a facility or (non-household) group with onset in a 14-day period. 
Positive cases are lab-confirmed. Confirmed deaths are lab-confirmed to be COVID-related.

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.We are getting many questions from our community around COVID-19. Frequently asked questions are included below and these are updated frequently. If you have a question that is not listed, please complete 
this form
. Someone from the Larimer County Department of Health & Environment will respond as soon as possible. 
If you are feeling sick or have medical questions, please call your healthcare provider.COVID-19
 is a disease caused by the new coronavirus strain.Coronaviruses 
are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses with symptoms that include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. These viruses spread through coughing or sneezing, much like the flu. Some coronaviruses are common and regularly cause illness in the U.S. in the fall and winter. Other coronaviruses, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, have caused outbreaks internationally and have been known to cause severe illness. Self-observation
 means people should remain alert for subjective fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. If they feel feverish or develop cough or difficulty breathing during the self-observation period, they should take their temperature, self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether a medical evaluation is needed.Self-monitoring
 means people should monitor themselves for fever by taking their temperatures twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing. If they feel feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing during the self-monitoring period, they should self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether a medical evaluation is needed.Active monitoring
 means that the state or local public health authority assumes responsibility for establishing regular communication with potentially exposed people to assess for the presence of fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. For people with high-risk exposures, CDC recommends this communication occurs at least once each day. The mode of communication can be determined by the state or local public health authority and may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.Close contact
 is defined as being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.Contact tracing
 is the process of public health identifying close contacts of a case of a communicable disease, including COVID-19, to identify any additional cases as early as possible to reduce additional exposures to an illness. Public health routinely conducts contact tracing for many communicable diseases including HIV, varicella (chickenpox), measles, and other illnesses.Public health orders
 are legally enforceable directives issued under the authority of a relevant federal, state, or local entity that, when applied to a person or group, may place restrictions on the activities undertaken by that person or group, potentially including movement restrictions or a requirement for monitoring by a public health authority, for the purposes of protecting the public’s health. Federal, state, or local public health orders may be issued to enforce isolation and/or quarantine.Isolation
 means the separation of a person or group of people known or believed to 
have
 a communicable disease and who are potentially infectious from those who do not have the disease to prevent the spread of the communicable disease. Isolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order.Quarantine
 in general means the separation of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been 
exposed
 to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease.Congregate settings
 are crowded public places where close contact with others may occur, such as shopping centers, movie theaters, stadiums.Social/physical distancing
 means remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.How did the COVID-19 outbreak begin?On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials alerted the World Health Organization of several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The pneumonia was caused by a virus that did not match any other known virus. This raised concerns because when a virus is new, public health officials do not know how it affects people.One week later, on January 7, 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus. The new virus is a type of coronavirus. It is from the same family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Since then, cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been identified in several countries. For the most current information on global and national cases, visit the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
 (CDC) and 
World Health Organization
 (WHO) websites. For up to date maps of the outbreak from Johns Hopkins University, click 
here
.How common is COVID-19 in Colorado?There are cases of COVID-19 in Larimer County and in Colorado. It is hard to know exactly how many people have had COVID-19 at this time because testing was so limited when this virus first arrived in the United States. Visit our 
case information page
 for the most current information on positive cases in Larimer County.The 
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
 provides data on COVID-19 cases across the state. Statewide data is available on their website 
here
.How is COVID-19 spread?COVID-19 is able to spread from person-to-person and is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced when someone who has the virus coughs. sneezes, or talks, similar to how influenza and other respiratory viruses spread. 
Someone can unknowingly spread the virus before they start to have symptoms.Who is at risk of getting COVID-19?It’s important to understand that risk is based on exposure. At this time, people at higher risk are:There are people of Chinese or Asian descent in my work/school/church/community - are they at higher risk for getting COVID-19?No, they are not at higher risk for getting COVID-19.  Like any other virus, no identity, community, ethnic, or racial group is more at risk for getting or spreading COVID-19. At this time, risk is based on recent travel to China and close contact with someone who is sick with COVID-19. What can I do to protect myself and my family from COVID-19?People who are worried about this, or any respiratory virus, like the flu, can protect themselves by practicing everyday actions:Do I need a facemask?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering to reduce the risk of unknowingly spreading the virus to others. These coverings should not be surgical masks or N95 masks because those are needed by our healthcare workers. Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?There is no vaccine for COVID-19 at this time, but there is a large national effort to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Should I cancel my travel plans?We encourage everyone to carefully consider their plans for travel to ensure that travel is as safe as possible. For more information about what to consider or plan on while traveling at this time, visit the 
CDC website about travel
.What should seniors, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions be doing? Those who are older or who have underlying health conditions are at higher risk of having severe complications from COVID-19.  
We've set up a page on this website to provide specific information for seniors and those with underlying health conditions that we will update frequently.Can packages or products shipped from China or other areas with COVID-19 be contaminated with the virus?There is a very low risk of spreading the virus from products or packages that are shipped over days and weeks. Coronaviruses are generally spread through respiratory droplets and don’t survive well on surfaces. There is still a lot unknown about how the virus spreads, but there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 through imported goods or shipped packages. Can I get COVID-19 again if I had it once?It is too early to know for sure. Other types of coronaviruses have been known to make someone who catches them sick again if they get it a second time but we don't yet know what the long-term immunity will be for this new coronavirus.What is the State of Colorado doing to respond to COVID-19?The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is prepared. The department and its partners are committed to protecting the health and safety of Coloradans, ensuring their response is proactive, strong and collaborative. Their response includes:Are people who have COVID-19 or who have been exposed to COVID-19 being isolated or quarantined?State and local public health are working together, following federal guidance, to assess those who have been exposed to COVID-19 to determine the need for monitoring and/or quarantine. How is the county supporting our seniors and reaching out to them with information?We are providing guidance to our long-term care facilities, retirement communities, and nursing homes regarding visitors, isolation, testing, etc. We're working with our local organizations that provide services/programs for seniors. We've talked with many seniors over the phone who want info to share with their friends.What is the total open capacity of hospital beds in Larimer county? Approximately how many additional patients can our hospitals handle?We have emergency response plans in place for local epidemics, which includes planning for mass hospitalizations. This includes working with regional hospitals to ensure beds are available when they are needed. For up to date information on our local hospital capacity, please visit our 
COVID-19 data dashboard
.Can I be evicted if I can't work due to COVID-19?Governor Polis recently updated his 
executive order
 limiting Evictions, Foreclosures, and Public Utility Connections. This executive order also helps to expedite unemployment insurance claims during COVID-19.

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.Registration is full for the week of July 13. Minimal walk-in slots are available each day, please check back for additional registration options. UC Health operates a drive-thru testing site. Additional information about this testing option can be found on the 
UC Health website
.Salud Family Health Centers also offers drive-thru testing at multiple locations. For more information, visit their 
website
. Larimer County Public Health, in partnership with local hospitals, has increased COVID-19 testing capacity in the community. Testing supplies have become more readily available and local providers have been able to provide testing options for their patients. Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 should call their provider to discuss symptoms and determine whether a COVID-19 test needs to be ordered.  Many providers locally can now order tests for their patients. Larimer County Public Health provides no-cost drive-thru testing on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:Anyone (ages 18 and older), with or without symptoms, is eligible for no cost testing with the health department for current infection with COVID-19. We do not offer antibody testing. People registering for testing must be at least 18 years of age. Walk-ins will be accepted but 
testing is prioritized for those who pre-register. 
Those who register will be notified of their appointment date and time via email once the registration has been reviewed for eligibility. We will select an appointment time for registrants to help us stagger arrival times at the testing location. This improves wait times and ensures that the testing process is quick and efficient. Talk with your health care provider if you’re interested in an antibody test. There are few FDA-authorized antibody tests so few of these tests have had the evaluation and testing to prove that they can provide trustworthy results. Some tests may only detect if you’ve been exposed to the virus, but can't determine if you are immune. Read more about antibody testing for COVID-19 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
here
.The management of COVID-19 has mainly focused on infection prevention, case detection and monitoring, and supportive care. There is no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) treatment recommended at this time because of the absence of evidence, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).However, people who recover (convalesce) from COVID-19 make antibodies against the virus in the plasma component of their blood. And evidence shows that this convalescent plasma can be used as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 without the occurrence of severe adverse events.UCHealth has 
already treated patients using this blood
 and is looking to identify potential donors of convalescent COVID-19 plasma to be able to treat more COVID-positive patients across the state.COVID-19 convalescent plasma may only be collected from COVID-19 recovered individuals if they are eligible to donate blood.You must have:If you suffered from a respiratory illness over the last eight weeks and believe you may have been exposed to COVID-19, you may be eligible to donate plasma in the near future. Please fill out the forms below. Then, if the opportunity arises for you to donate plasma, coordinators will follow up with you soon. In Northern Colorado: Contact UCHealth Garth Englund Blood Center donor recruiter Kaitlin Zobel: 970.495.8987, or 
fill out this form
 and someone will contact you. Details on their process and scheduling can be found 
here.Please 
self-isolate at home 
until at least 10 days after your symptoms start AND 72 hours after your symptoms go away. Seek medical care right away if your illness is getting worse

Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider.Call 911 if you have a medical emergencyWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This is especially important after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.Soap and water: Soap and water are the best option, especially if hands are visibly dirty.Avoid touching: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available. If you need to be around other people in or outside of the home, wear a facemask. Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people in your home. After using these items, wash them thoroughly with soap and water or put in the dishwasher.Clean high-touch surfaces in your isolation area (“sick room” and bathroom) every day; let a caregiver clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in other areas of the home.High-touch surfaces include phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Note:

Before going to the doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them your symptoms. Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider.



Call 911 if you have a medical emergency

As much as possible, you should stay in a specific “sick room” and away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available.

Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.



Soap and water: Soap and water are the best option, especially if hands are visibly dirty.



Avoid touching: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.



 Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people in your home.



 After using these items, wash them thoroughly with soap and water or put in the dishwasher.

Clean and disinfect: Routinely clean high-touch surfaces in your “sick room” and bathroom. Let someone else clean and disinfect surfaces in common areas, but not your bedroom and bathroom.
	


If a caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect a sick person’s bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis. The caregiver/other person should wear a mask and wait as long as possible after the sick person has used the bathroom.



If a caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect a sick person’s bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis. The caregiver/other person should wear a mask and wait as long as possible after the sick person has used the bathroom.Clean and disinfect areas that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.Household cleaners and disinfectants: Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty. Then, use a household disinfectant.
	


Be sure to follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many products recommend keeping the surface wet for several minutes to ensure germs are killed. Many also recommend precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.Disease investigations are an important way that public health officials can help prevent the spread of disease in a community. When someone tests positive for a reportable condition, such as COVID-19, that test result is reported to state or local public health officials. Local public health staff receive that report and work with the patient to identify any close contacts who may have been exposed to the disease and could become ill. This process is known as 
contact tracing
.Public health staff then warn these exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible. Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they themselves do not feel ill.The information collected about cases and contacts of cases is kept private.
 Larimer County Department of Health and Environment follows the following privacy practices for disease investigations:For up to date information on Larimer County job opportunities, including opportunities at the health department, please

- Strategies to maintain a minimum of 6 feet physical distancing must be used throughout the ceremony. Options include doing “drive-in” style ceremonies, streaming presentations and speakers, calling small groups of less than 10 graduates at a time to the presentation stage, etc. Guests of Graduates
 - Family and friends of graduates in attendance in person need to be limited in order to maintain physical distancing requirements and overall event size. Members of the same household as the graduate may attend as a group. Extended family members or other guests outside of the household must adhere to physical distancing requirements.  Delivery of Diplomas
 - Deliver diplomas to graduates after the ceremony via mail, or have graduates collect diplomas from the stage individually rather than being handed out by administration. CDC FAQs for Schools and AdministratorsCough or sneeze into their sleeved arm or cover their mouth and nose with a tissue. Throw away the tissue after they use it and wash their hands.Avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouthWash their hands frequently and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, especially after they cough or sneeze; an alcohol-based hand rub can be used if soap and water are not nearbyAvoid sharing cups and eating utensils with othersClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces such as doorknobs, tables, drinking fountains, and handrails. Regular cleaning products can be used. Avoid family style serving if possible. We recommend that adults prepare each child's plate using gloves.If napping mats are used, children should be kept 6 feet apart if possible and mats should be cleaned after each use.Any staff notified of a suspected illness should inform the designated staff member as soon as possible.The designated staff member, in coordination with the registered school nurse, should 
report the suspected illness to us using

Exclude children, students, or staff who have fever and respiratory symptoms from childcare, school, or work until 
at least 24 hours after they no longer have fever or signs of a fever
 (chills, feeling very warm, flushed appearance, or sweating) without the use of a medication that reduces fever.

at least 24 hours after they no longer have fever or signs of a fever
 (chills, feeling very warm, flushed appearance, or sweating) without the use of a medication that reduces fever.Ill children, students, and staff should be separated from others until they can be picked up or go home.Remember that schools are not expected to screen students and staff for COVID-19. The majority of respiratory illnesses are not COVID-19. If a community or school has cases of COVID-19, the health department will help identify those individuals and follow up on next steps.Share 
resources
 with parents and families to help them understand when to keep children home.Review the usual absenteeism patterns at your school/child care among both students and staff. 
	


Alert us via the form linked above about increases in student and staff absenteeism, particularly if absences appear due to respiratory illnesses (like the common cold or the “flu,” which have symptoms similar to COVID-19).


If possible, school/child care personnel monitoring attendance should ask the following information: 

		▪ Name of student or child

		▪ Symptoms of the child – especially for fever plus cough and/or shortness of breath 

		▪ Have they been seen by a medical provider

Require students and staff to stay home when sick.
 Use flexibility, when possible, to allow staff to stay home to care for sick family members.Identify critical job functions and positions, and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff. Determine what level of absenteeism will disrupt continuity of teaching and learning. Routinely clean frequently touched surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handrails) with cleaners you would typically use according to the directions on the product label.Provide disposable wipes so that commonly used surfaces (e.g., keyboards, desks, and remote controls) can be wiped down by students and staff before each use.Include strategies for sharing information with staff, students, and their families.Include information about steps being taken by the school or childcare facility to prepare, and how additional information will be shared.  Direct parents and families to our website and social media channels for the most current and reliable information about COVID-19.ApplyCheck

https://www.americanchemistry.com/Novel-Coronavirus-Fighting-Products-List.pdfWhen a child presents with COVID-like or communicable disease symptoms, especially if the symptoms, (cough, vomiting, diarrhea), that might be explained by overeating, overexertion, allergies, etc. it is important to isolate and observe the child for additional symptoms. Isolation can occur at the center as long as they are kept out of the general population. If symptoms worsen, then the child should be sent home. If symptoms resolve and can be explained away by one of the situations listed above, the child may return to the general population. In the event symptoms do not resolve or worsen, the child must be isolated until they are able to be picked up by a parent or guardian. Testing for COVID-19 is strongly recommended to verify the diagnosis of COVID-19. In the absence of testing, or if the child tests positive, they are to remain home and isolated for at least 10 days following their first symptom, plus 72 hours after fever resolves and when other symptoms are improving.It depends on whether there is a concern that the child was exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., a known exposure or close contact of someone who is positive for COVID-19) to the parent’s knowledge. If there is a high level of suspicion that the child had contact or was exposed to someone with COVID-19, they should be excluded for 10 days (isolation). If there is a low index of suspicion (not a close contact, no known exposure), and a clear alternative diagnosis from a healthcare provider, the child can return based on the childcare center's exclusion policy for fever. This is typically 24-48 hours.If there is a high level of suspicion that the child was exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., a known exposure or close contact of someone who is positive for COVID-19) they should wait the entire 10 days prior to returning to care even with a negative test result. If there is a low index of suspicion for COVID-19 (not a close contact, no known exposure), they can return according to the normal exclusion criteria for that symptom(s), e.g., for fever, 24 hours with no symptoms.While testing is highly recommended, a healthcare provider can provide a note with a clear alternative diagnosis and the child could come back 24 hours symptom-free or whatever the center’s exclusion is for their alternative condition/symptom. For example, if a child has a fever and is positive for strep, the provider may forgo COVID-19 testing since there is a likely diagnosis and the child could return to care based on the center’s strep exclusion. Notify and work with the health department to determine next steps and make decisions about closures.If someone is positive for COVID-19, they must stay isolated for 10 days from the first day they started having symptoms (or in the absence of symptoms, 10 days since the date they were tested) plus 72 hours fever-free and with having an improvement in symptoms.According to the latest guidance available on the CDPHE website, a minimum of 24 hours. 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n76Fry-VIGQpOeF5zM2CueTHTjc6g-jG/viewChild care centers, family child care homes, and building-based school-age programs. This does not apply for school-age day camps, license-exempt youth programs, or resident camps.There is nothing that prohibits field trips. However, all physical distancing requirements are required including keeping children 6 feet apart while transporting.Mats/cots should be placed 6 feet apart. It is recommended that children be spaced head to toe. Mats, cots and sheets should be stored and washed as you normally would.Staff should wear gloves as they normally would for activities such as diaper changing, handling body fluids, and handling ready to eat food. Gloves may also need to be worn when conducting screenings.Note:

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.People who have the virus but do not have symptoms can spread the virus without knowing it. This can happen in two situations:The purpose of a cloth face covering is to protect others around you in case you have the virus but don't know it.
 Cloth face coverings should:Face coverings help to reduce air droplets that are breathed out onto others when we talk, sneeze or cough which may spread COVID-19 when someone doesn't know they have the virus.When out of your home in a setting where physical distancing is challenging, we strongly recommend wearing a face covering. Local businesses are required to make sure that everyone in their facility is wearing a face covering, including customers, unless they have implemented
 
additional physical distancing measures. May 3, 2020- Larimer County 
Face Coverings in Businesses Order
 May 30, 2020- 
Larimer County Amended Face Coverings OrderAlternative to Face Covering ChecklistOn 6/4/2020, Governor Polis issued 
Executive Order D 2020 092
 that allows businesses to deny service to customers who do not wear a mask in their facility.There is no need to wear a face-covering at your home or when you are doing something by yourself a minimum of 6 feet or more away from other people, such as walking your dog. This order does not apply to children under age two (2) or to those people for whom a face covering would cause harm due to an existing health condition. It also does not apply to those working in a location where they will not be within 6 feet of any other individuals or persons working in a professional office who do not have any face-to-face interactions with the public.These coverings should be made of homemade materials and be washable. According to 
coloradomaskproject.com
, all coverings should have:If you are sick, 
get tested
, stay home and self isolate, and 
report your symptoms on our self-reporting dashboard
. If your employer recommends the use of a face covering, refer to your agency’s policy/procedures for guidance. For more information about cloth face coverings from CDC, please visit 
their website
.It is not known if face shields provide any benefit as source control to protect others from the spray of respiratory particles. CDC does not recommend the use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings. 
Critical/essential workers cannot substitute a cloth face covering with a face shield
 but may wear a face shield with a face covering for additional protection.Some people may choose to use a face shield when sustained close contact with other people is expected. If face shields are used without a mask, they should wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin. Disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use. Reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use. 
Plastic face shields for newborns and infants are NOT recommended.Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators. Currently, those are critical supplies that should continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Cloth face coverings also are not appropriate substitutes for them in workplaces where masks or respirators are recommended or required and available.Absolutely. The distance and the mask together help provide extra protection when out in the community.If a business has a sign posted that states they require customers to wear masks, you must wear a mask unless you can not do so safely due to a medical condition.If a business has a sign that states they have implemented alternative safety measures and are not requiring customers to wear masks, you do not have to wear a mask, but we encourage you to do so. CDC recommends that everyone over age 2 wear a mask. We're asking that everyone do their best, but we recognize that many children won't tolerate having a mask on. Cloth face coverings or masks should be worn whenever you are visiting a local business or in close proximity to others outside of your household. See the Amended Face Covering Order for Larimer County here.There is no documentation required and you do not need to explain that you have a medical condition. The Health Department requires that businesses post signage and remind customers that they require masks, but businesses do not need to be confrontational. Businesses who do not want to enforce that customers wear face-coverings must implement 
alternative safety measures.  If wearing a mask poses a risk to your health, stay at home as much as possible.Cloth masks are available through a variety of venues. Many are simple and 
easy to make
 with supplies you might have at home, such as an old T-shirt. Friends and loved ones may be able to make some for you or they can be purchased online through online vendors and crafters.Cloth face coverings are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and don't know it from spreading it to others unknowingly. Cloth face coverings help keep respiratory droplets that are exhaled from getting onto others. The masks protect the people around you from you, not you from them.Medical grade masks, surgical masks, and N95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers or other medical first responders, as recommended by CDC guidance.We know how frustrating that is. Thank you for doing your part by wearing a face covering when you’re out. The state order requires that essential workers wear face coverings or masks. Local orders require that face coverings be worn by employees and customers in a business. Larimer County's Face-Covering order states that someone who can not wear a face-covering due to breathing difficulties or medical issues does not need to wear one.  Other customers and individuals should not become confrontational with other people for not wearing a mask. Do not call 911, the police, or the Sheriff’s Office to report someone not wearing a mask. It is not known if face shields provide any benefit to protect others from the spray of respiratory particles from the person wearing the shield. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings. 
Critical/essential workers cannot substitute a cloth face covering with a face shield
 but may wear a face shield with a face covering for additional protection.Help fight COVID-19 by making fabric face coverings for our local essential workers. Homemade masks should be:Drop off homemade face coverings Monday-Friday between 8am and 4:30pm at:Note:

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.Certain individuals are at higher risk for adverse health complications if they contract this virus. This includes:Those who might also be at increased risk include:Now that COVID-19 is present in our community, we recommend that those who are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19 minimize their contact with people in the community outside of their immediate household. For more information and recommendations for those who are at higher risk, visit the 
CDC website
.Protecting Yourself and Your Loved Ones From COVID-19...through everyday actions...through physical distancing...by being preparedActivities are safer if you can maintain at least 6 feet of space between you and others, because COVID-19 spreads easier between people who are within 6 feet of each other. Indoor spaces with less ventilation where it might be harder to keep people apart are more risky than outdoor spaces. Interacting without wearing cloth face coverings also increases your risk. When deciding to participate in various activities, consider the level of risk that activity may carry for being exposed to COVID-19 or exposing others.The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:Before participating in an activity consider:Not everyone has a safe home to shelter in during this outbreak. Domestic violence and child abuse may increase as individuals experience increased stress while survivors and their abusers are sheltered together for long periods of time. With more individuals out of work or working remotely and with children not able to attend school, these forms of violence have fewer opportunities to be noticed and addressed. It is particularly important during this time to check in on friends and neighbors. Many services are still open and available to help those who are affected by interpersonal violence.ResourcesNote:

Instead, greet people by waving, or just saying hello.Increase the physical distance between people to six feet to help reduce spread. Consider keeping more distance between yourself and others when exercising or when around others who are exercising (biking, running, walking).Encourage your friends, family, and neighbors to maintain physical distancing.Carefully consider your travel plans and how to keep your risk of getting COVID-19 as low as possible while traveling. Visit the 
CDC COVID-19 travel website
