Douglas County Disaster Emergency Waivers for Businesses to Address COVID-19 Safety Provisions
In anticipation that some businesses will need to modify buildings to accommodate social distancing and other safety measures aimed at minimizing the transmission of COVID-19, the Board of County Commissioners adopted a resolution to temporarily enable the Planning Director to grant waivers to some zoning requirements so that businesses are able to make operational modifications quickly and inexpensively.  Examples of the types of modifications that may be requested are expanding the seating area of a restaurant into a patio area, converting parking areas to drive-up lanes to provide curb-side takeout, or adding an external door to enable better circulation within a store.
Please contact Planning Services at 303-660-7460 or [email protected] to inquire about your business needs.
