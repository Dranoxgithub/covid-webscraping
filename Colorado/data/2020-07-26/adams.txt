Scraping from http://www.adcogov.org/news/adams-county-treasurer-culpepper-continue-temporary-waiver-interest-property-tax-payments


Posted on: July 21, 2020The Adams County Treasurer continues to waive interest charges on delinquent payments through the end of August 2020.By working closely with state legislators and county treasurers from Jefferson, Boulder, Summit, and Eagle Counties, the bill was signed into law by Governor Jared Polis on June 14, 2020. The Treasurer, with new statutory authority, immediately approved the continuing waiver through July 31, 2020, for all of Adams County taxpayers, and has decided to again waive interest through August 31, 2020. No further waivers of interest are anticipated, so paying on or before August 31, 2020, is required.In June, the Adams County Board of County Commissioners made clear their support of county taxpayers by their vote on the record in the Public Meeting held in late June. This further evidenced their approval of waiving interest, at the Treasurer’s discretion, in their written Resolution the following week.The Treasurer makes clear that her approval of waiving interest is limited law and by county economic factors; interest will again be due and owing for any taxpayer whom has not paid, in full, their real property or business personal property tax on or before August 31, 2020.  This is a window of opportunity being provided to the taxpayers of Adams County to pay their taxes interest-free in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Adams County Treasurer will continue, with her colleague Treasurers in Summit, Jefferson, Boulder, and Eagle Counties, to work with the state legislature to remove very old restrictions on the constitutionally elected county treasurers’ authorities from statutes.  While, as Summit County Treasurer Ryne Scholl stated, the county treasurers’ “…authority granted in” Colorado House Bill 20-1421 “to implement [tax collections] strategy will sunset in 2020,” many county treasurers, including Adams County Treasurer Culpepper, will continue advocating for the constitutional authority of the County Treasurer to more closely align with the Colorado Constitution, and to work with county taxpayers on payment plans and interest waivers.Culpepper’s office is encouraging the Adams County taxpayers to submit payment as soon as possible, and to not wait until August 31. The collection of property taxes is vital to the funding of daily operations of the county; for funding Fire protection and response; and, to continue the operations of water/sanitation services (amongst many other services provided) in Adams County.The policy is open to anyone but does not extend to accounts where the taxes are remitted by a mortgage company through a taxpayer’s escrow account or by a title company as part of a real estate closing.Payment and interest information is available on the Treasurer’s tax history and payment website at 
www.adcotax.com
 (fastest source of information); by emailing the Treasurer’s Office at 
treasurer@adcogov.org
 (fast); or, as a last resort, by calling the Treasurer’s Office at 720.523.6160 (due to COVID-19 remote working, it may be a business day or two before a return call is made, so be sure to answer if you see a 720.523.6160 call).

Posted on: July 13, 2020July 10, 2020 - 
Today, Tri-County Health Department (TCHD) issued the 
Public Health Order Requiring Facial Coverings in Public Where Social Distancing Cannot be Maintained
 that was approved by its Board of Health on July 8.  At that meeting, TCHD staff recommended that the Board of Health consider a public health order requiring masking for all three counties. A mandate was recommended for Adams County and Aurora, which have the highest incidence rates; either an opt-out or opt-in mandate for Arapahoe County, which has a somewhat lower incidence rate; and an opt-in mandate for Douglas County, which has the lowest rate. Following discussion, the Board voted to allow elected officials and jurisdictions in all three counties to determine the use of the mandate requiring face coverings in a similar manner, through an opt-out process.The Order requires that people wear facial coverings in public spaces in cities and counties that have not opted-out of the Order in Adams, Arapahoe, and Douglas Counties. TCHD enacted the Order to help control and slow the spread of COVID-19. This Order will go into effect on Friday, July 24.“Over the past month, there has been a concerning increase in cases which led to our decision to issue this Order. As of July 9, incidence rates per 100,000 over the past 14 days in our counties were 124 for Adams County, 76 for Arapahoe County, and 68 for Douglas County. The 
number of cases per day
 has increased substantially in all three counties over the past month, particularly in the past several days,” said Executive Director, John M. Douglas, Jr., MD. “Prevention is the best tool we have in fighting COVID-19 and we have 
scientific evidence
 that masks can play an important role in slowing the spread of COVID-19, which can help in reopening and keeping our economy open. Keeping transmission rates from climbing is particularly important as our schools make plans to re-open as fully as possible next month.”This Order requires masks in public places with several specific exceptions, such as those who cannot wear a mask due to medical or mental health conditions or children two years and under. Cities and counties within the TCHD jurisdiction will have the choice to opt-out of this Order via an email notification by Thursday, July 23.  Instructions on opting out are in the 
public health order
. Douglas County has already announced that they will opt-out of the order, and, in addition, that they will leave TCHD’s jurisdiction and form their own health department."We are at least a couple of weeks away from requiring masks, but we need to continue to make thoughtful efforts to always wear our masks when we go out in public, said Executive Director, John M. Douglas, Jr., MD. “We strongly encourage everyone to wear masks especially inside places where social distancing cannot be maintained.”Continue to protect yourself and others by wearing masks, maintaining more than 6 feet distance from others, frequent hand washing, and staying home when you are sick.

Posted on: June 22, 2020A Jefferson County judge ordered the City and County of Denver to pay Adams County more than $33 million for violations of an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) regarding noise levels at Denver International Airport (DIA) during the years of 2014, 2015, and 2016. DIA was found in violation of 67 Class II noise exposure performance standards (NEPS) during the aforementioned years. NEPS are used to measure noise levels of aircraft flying over Adams County.“We’re grateful to the Jefferson County judge for taking the necessary time to evaluate this complex case and return a judgement that delivers justice to Adams County,” said Board Chair Emma Pinter. “This is an agreement between Denver and Adams County and we both have an obligation to uphold this agreement.”The IGA between the two entities allowed Denver to annex land within Adams County to build a new airport, in exchange for Denver’s agreement to monitor and strictly limit the noise exposure levels at DIA. If noise levels exceed the agreed upon limit, and are not remedied within the time allowed, Denver must make a noise mitigation payment for each violation.“We are pleased with the decision that was made today, and feel it is fair and just,” said Commissioner Mary Hodge. “This has been a tough and unfortunate situation, but it was necessary to ensure quality of life for our residents.”The IGA provides specific procedures and remedies to be followed and allows Adams County to bring legal action to enforce the NEPS, or may seek noise mitigation payments based upon the NEPS violations.“While we never want to end up in court with a partner jurisdiction, this judgement validates concerns from Adams County residents.” said Commissioner Steve O’Dorisio.The county filed the first legal complaint against the City and County of Denver in 1992 based on perceived violations of the IGA that could not be resolved. Subsequent complaints were filed over the years – all relating to noise level monitoring and violations.“We’re disappointed that Denver wasn’t willing to solve this out of court,” said Commissioner Eva Henry. “We had hoped to partner with them to resolve this in a more amicable manner without having to take these steps.”Given the recent nature of this decision, the county will take some time to assess how to best use these funds.“We are thankful the Jefferson County judge upheld the IGA between Adams County and the City and County of Denver,” said Commissioner Chaz Tedesco. “This allows us to move ahead under the conditions of the current IGA.”In addition, it was determined that Denver must report NEPS compliance based on the Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring System (ANOMS) as long as the ANOMS remains as the only noise monitoring system installed at the airport, and Adams County may rely on the data measured by the ANOMS to determine compliance with the NEPS.
