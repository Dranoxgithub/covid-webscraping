Positive test results for COVID-19 are reported to the health department in a variety of ways for investigation and follow-up. Cases of COVID-19 are recorded as a case in the county where they permanently reside. 
Cases recorded here are Larimer County residents only.
 As we work through investigating cases originally assigned to and reported by Larimer County, they may be assigned to another county if we determine their permanent address is outside of the county.A case may be classified as confirmed, probable, or suspect depending on the characteristics of the person when diagnosed or how they were tested.Confirmed and probable cases are likely to be able to spread the virus at the time their test was done so these cases are investigated by public health to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19. At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Colorado, serologic testing was not available and a system to track probable cases that could not be tested due to limitations in available testing was not yet in place. Now that serologic testing and testing for active infections are now more available, suspect and probable cases are now being reported and tracked, sometimes retroactively, by public health officials. As we are receiving a larger volume of probable and suspect cases being reported to us, a trend that is likely to continue, LCDHE has added these differentiations to our case data. 
This page is being updated to reflect these different case types.
 Larimer County continues to do a good job flattening the curve. Compared to other large counties in the state, Larimer County continues to see noticeably lower COVID-19 cases and deaths.To protect the privacy of individuals, Larimer County will not publicly share any identifying information about COVID-19 cases. The most effective way to prevent COVID-19 is to stay home and avoid contact with everyone except for those in your household.**Probable deaths (possible connection to a COVID-19 case but testing was never completed) 
 CSVTwo or more lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a facility or (non-household) group with onset in a 14-day period. 
Positive cases are lab-confirmed. Confirmed deaths are lab-confirmed to be COVID-related.

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.We are getting many questions from our community around COVID-19. Frequently asked questions are included below and these are updated frequently. If you have a question that is not listed, please complete 
this form
. Someone from the Larimer County Department of Health & Environment will respond as soon as possible. 
If you are feeling sick or have medical questions, please call your healthcare provider.COVID-19
 is a disease caused by the new coronavirus strain.Coronaviruses 
are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses with symptoms that include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. These viruses spread through coughing or sneezing, much like the flu. Some coronaviruses are common and regularly cause illness in the U.S. in the fall and winter. Other coronaviruses, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, have caused outbreaks internationally and have been known to cause severe illness. Self-observation
 means people should remain alert for subjective fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. If they feel feverish or develop cough or difficulty breathing during the self-observation period, they should take their temperature, self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether a medical evaluation is needed.Self-monitoring
 means people should monitor themselves for fever by taking their temperatures twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing. If they feel feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing during the self-monitoring period, they should self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether a medical evaluation is needed.Active monitoring
 means that the state or local public health authority assumes responsibility for establishing regular communication with potentially exposed people to assess for the presence of fever, cough, or difficulty breathing. For people with high-risk exposures, CDC recommends this communication occurs at least once each day. The mode of communication can be determined by the state or local public health authority and may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.Close contact
 is defined as being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.Contact tracing
 is the process of public health identifying close contacts of a case of a communicable disease, including COVID-19, to identify any additional cases as early as possible to reduce additional exposures to an illness. Public health routinely conducts contact tracing for many communicable diseases including HIV, varicella (chickenpox), measles, and other illnesses.Public health orders
 are legally enforceable directives issued under the authority of a relevant federal, state, or local entity that, when applied to a person or group, may place restrictions on the activities undertaken by that person or group, potentially including movement restrictions or a requirement for monitoring by a public health authority, for the purposes of protecting the public’s health. Federal, state, or local public health orders may be issued to enforce isolation and/or quarantine.Isolation
 means the separation of a person or group of people known or believed to 
have
 a communicable disease and who are potentially infectious from those who do not have the disease to prevent the spread of the communicable disease. Isolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order.Quarantine
 in general means the separation of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been 
exposed
 to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease.Congregate settings
 are crowded public places where close contact with others may occur, such as shopping centers, movie theaters, stadiums.Social/physical distancing
 means remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.How did the COVID-19 outbreak begin?On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials alerted the World Health Organization of several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The pneumonia was caused by a virus that did not match any other known virus. This raised concerns because when a virus is new, public health officials do not know how it affects people.One week later, on January 7, 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus. The new virus is a type of coronavirus. It is from the same family of viruses that include the common cold, and viruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Since then, cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, have been identified in several countries. For the most current information on global and national cases, visit the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
 (CDC) and 
World Health Organization
 (WHO) websites. For up to date maps of the outbreak from Johns Hopkins University, click 
here
.How common is COVID-19 in Colorado?There are cases of COVID-19 in Larimer County and in Colorado. It is hard to know exactly how many people have had COVID-19 at this time because testing was so limited when this virus first arrived in the United States. Visit our 
case information page
 for the most current information on positive cases in Larimer County.The 
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
 provides data on COVID-19 cases across the state. Statewide data is available on their website 
here
.How is COVID-19 spread?COVID-19 is able to spread from person-to-person and is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced when someone who has the virus coughs. sneezes, or talks, similar to how influenza and other respiratory viruses spread. 
Someone can unknowingly spread the virus before they start to have symptoms.Who is at risk of getting COVID-19?It’s important to understand that risk is based on exposure. At this time, people at higher risk are:There are people of Chinese or Asian descent in my work/school/church/community - are they at higher risk for getting COVID-19?No, they are not at higher risk for getting COVID-19.  Like any other virus, no identity, community, ethnic, or racial group is more at risk for getting or spreading COVID-19. At this time, risk is based on recent travel to China and close contact with someone who is sick with COVID-19. What can I do to protect myself and my family from COVID-19?People who are worried about this, or any respiratory virus, like the flu, can protect themselves by practicing everyday actions:Do I need a facemask?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering to reduce the risk of unknowingly spreading the virus to others. These coverings should not be surgical masks or N95 masks because those are needed by our healthcare workers. Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?There is no vaccine for COVID-19 at this time, but there is a large national effort to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Should I cancel my travel plans?We encourage everyone to carefully consider their plans for travel to ensure that travel is as safe as possible. For more information about what to consider or plan on while traveling at this time, visit the 
CDC website about travel
.What should seniors, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions be doing? Those who are older or who have underlying health conditions are at higher risk of having severe complications from COVID-19.  
We've set up a page on this website to provide specific information for seniors and those with underlying health conditions that we will update frequently.Can packages or products shipped from China or other areas with COVID-19 be contaminated with the virus?There is a very low risk of spreading the virus from products or packages that are shipped over days and weeks. Coronaviruses are generally spread through respiratory droplets and don’t survive well on surfaces. There is still a lot unknown about how the virus spreads, but there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 through imported goods or shipped packages. Can I get COVID-19 again if I had it once?It is too early to know for sure. Other types of coronaviruses have been known to make someone who catches them sick again if they get it a second time but we don't yet know what the long-term immunity will be for this new coronavirus.What is the State of Colorado doing to respond to COVID-19?The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is prepared. The department and its partners are committed to protecting the health and safety of Coloradans, ensuring their response is proactive, strong and collaborative. Their response includes:Are people who have COVID-19 or who have been exposed to COVID-19 being isolated or quarantined?State and local public health are working together, following federal guidance, to assess those who have been exposed to COVID-19 to determine the need for monitoring and/or quarantine. How is the county supporting our seniors and reaching out to them with information?We are providing guidance to our long-term care facilities, retirement communities, and nursing homes regarding visitors, isolation, testing, etc. We're working with our local organizations that provide services/programs for seniors. We've talked with many seniors over the phone who want info to share with their friends.What is the total open capacity of hospital beds in Larimer county? Approximately how many additional patients can our hospitals handle?We have emergency response plans in place for local epidemics, which includes planning for mass hospitalizations. This includes working with regional hospitals to ensure beds are available when they are needed. For up to date information on our local hospital capacity, please visit our 
COVID-19 data dashboard
.Can I be evicted if I can't work due to COVID-19?Governor Polis recently updated his 
executive order
 limiting Evictions, Foreclosures, and Public Utility Connections. This executive order also helps to expedite unemployment insurance claims during COVID-19.

 for upcoming test dates. Minimal walk-in slots are available each day, pre-registration recommended. UC Health operates a drive-thru testing site. Additional information about this testing option can be found on the 
UC Health website
.Salud Family Health Centers also offers drive-thru testing at multiple locations. For more information, visit their 
website
. Larimer County Public Health, in partnership with local hospitals, has increased COVID-19 testing capacity in the community. Testing supplies have become more readily available and local providers have been able to provide testing options for their patients. Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 should call their provider to discuss symptoms and determine whether a COVID-19 test needs to be ordered.  Many providers locally can now order tests for their patients. Larimer County Public Health provides no-cost drive-thru testing on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:Anyone (ages 18 and older), with or without symptoms, is eligible for no cost testing with the health department for current infection with COVID-19. We do not offer antibody testing. People registering for testing must be at least 18 years of age. Walk-ins will be accepted but 
testing is prioritized for those who pre-register. 
Those who register will be notified of their appointment date and time via email once the registration has been reviewed for eligibility. We will select an appointment time for registrants to help us stagger arrival times at the testing location. This improves wait times and ensures that the testing process is quick and efficient. Talk with your health care provider if you’re interested in an antibody test. There are few FDA-authorized antibody tests so few of these tests have had the evaluation and testing to prove that they can provide trustworthy results. Some tests may only detect if you’ve been exposed to the virus, but can't determine if you are immune. Read more about antibody testing for COVID-19 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
here
.The management of COVID-19 has mainly focused on infection prevention, case detection and monitoring, and supportive care. There is no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) treatment recommended at this time because of the absence of evidence, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).However, people who recover (convalesce) from COVID-19 make antibodies against the virus in the plasma component of their blood. And evidence shows that this convalescent plasma can be used as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 without the occurrence of severe adverse events.UCHealth has 
already treated patients using this blood
 and is looking to identify potential donors of convalescent COVID-19 plasma to be able to treat more COVID-positive patients across the state.COVID-19 convalescent plasma may only be collected from COVID-19 recovered individuals if they are eligible to donate blood.You must have:If you suffered from a respiratory illness over the last eight weeks and believe you may have been exposed to COVID-19, you may be eligible to donate plasma in the near future. Please fill out the forms below. Then, if the opportunity arises for you to donate plasma, coordinators will follow up with you soon. In Northern Colorado: To learn more or to schedule a convalescent plasma donation, contact Kaitlin Zobel: 970.495.8987, or 
fill out this form
 and someone will contact you. Details on their process and scheduling can be found 
 
here.Please 
self-isolate at home 
until at least 10 days after your symptoms start AND 72 hours after your symptoms go away. Seek medical care right away if your illness is getting worse
 (for example, if you have difficulty breathing).Before going to the doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them your symptoms. Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider.Call 911 if you have a medical emergencyWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This is especially important after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.Soap and water: Soap and water are the best option, especially if hands are visibly dirty.Avoid touching: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available. If you need to be around other people in or outside of the home, wear a facemask. Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people in your home. After using these items, wash them thoroughly with soap and water or put in the dishwasher.Clean high-touch surfaces in your isolation area (“sick room” and bathroom) every day; let a caregiver clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in other areas of the home.High-touch surfaces include phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. Note:

Call 911 if you have a medical emergency

As much as possible, you should stay in a specific “sick room” and away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available.

Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.



Soap and water: Soap and water are the best option, especially if hands are visibly dirty.



Avoid touching: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.



 Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people in your home.



 After using these items, wash them thoroughly with soap and water or put in the dishwasher.

Clean and disinfect: Routinely clean high-touch surfaces in your “sick room” and bathroom. Let someone else clean and disinfect surfaces in common areas, but not your bedroom and bathroom.
	


If a caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect a sick person’s bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis. The caregiver/other person should wear a mask and wait as long as possible after the sick person has used the bathroom.

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.Disease investigations are an important way that public health officials can help prevent the spread of disease in a community. When someone tests positive for a reportable condition, such as COVID-19, that test result is reported to state or local public health officials. Local public health staff receive that report and work with the patient to identify any close contacts who may have been exposed to the disease and could become ill. This process is known as 
contact tracing
.Public health staff then warn these exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible. Contacts are provided with education, information, and support to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they themselves do not feel ill.The information collected about cases and contacts of cases is kept private.
 Larimer County Department of Health and Environment follows the following privacy practices for disease investigations:For up to date information on Larimer County job opportunities, including opportunities at the health department, please

- Strategies to maintain a minimum of 6 feet physical distancing must be used throughout the ceremony. Options include doing “drive-in” style ceremonies, streaming presentations and speakers, calling small groups of less than 10 graduates at a time to the presentation stage, etc. Guests of Graduates
 - Family and friends of graduates in attendance in person need to be limited in order to maintain physical distancing requirements and overall event size. Members of the same household as the graduate may attend as a group. Extended family members or other guests outside of the household must adhere to physical distancing requirements.  Delivery of Diplomas
 - Deliver diplomas to graduates after the ceremony via mail, or have graduates collect diplomas from the stage individually rather than being handed out by administration. CDC FAQs for Schools and AdministratorsCough or sneeze into their sleeved arm or cover their mouth and nose with a tissue. Throw away the tissue after they use it and wash their hands.Avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouthWash their hands frequently and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, especially after they cough or sneeze; an alcohol-based hand rub can be used if soap and water are not nearbyAvoid sharing cups and eating utensils with othersClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces such as doorknobs, tables, drinking fountains, and handrails. Regular cleaning products can be used. Avoid family style serving if possible. We recommend that adults prepare each child's plate using gloves.If napping mats are used, children should be kept 6 feet apart if possible and mats should be cleaned after each use.Any staff notified of a suspected illness should inform the designated staff member as soon as possible.The designated staff member, in coordination with the registered school nurse, should

at least 24 hours after they no longer have fever or signs of a fever
 (chills, feeling very warm, flushed appearance, or sweating) without the use of a medication that reduces fever.Ill children, students, and staff should be separated from others until they can be picked up or go home.Remember that schools are not expected to screen students and staff for COVID-19. The majority of respiratory illnesses are not COVID-19. If a community or school has cases of COVID-19, the health department will help identify those individuals and follow up on next steps.Share 
resources
 with parents and families to help them understand when to keep children home.Review the usual absenteeism patterns at your school/child care among both students and staff. 
	


Alert us via the form linked above about increases in student and staff absenteeism, particularly if absences appear due to respiratory illnesses (like the common cold or the “flu,” which have symptoms similar to COVID-19).


If possible, school/child care personnel monitoring attendance should ask the following information: 

		▪ Name of student or child

		▪ Symptoms of the child – especially for fever plus cough and/or shortness of breath 

		▪ Have they been seen by a medical provider

Require students and staff to stay home when sick.
 Use flexibility, when possible, to allow staff to stay home to care for sick family members.Identify critical job functions and positions, and plan for alternative coverage by cross-training staff. Determine what level of absenteeism will disrupt continuity of teaching and learning. Routinely clean frequently touched surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handrails) with cleaners you would typically use according to the directions on the product label.Provide disposable wipes so that commonly used surfaces (e.g., keyboards, desks, and remote controls) can be wiped down by students and staff before each use.Include strategies for sharing information with staff, students, and their families.Include information about steps being taken by the school or childcare facility to prepare, and how additional information will be shared.  Direct parents and families to our website and social media channels for the most current and reliable information about COVID-19.ApplyCheck

https://www.americanchemistry.com/Novel-Coronavirus-Fighting-Products-List.pdfWhen a child presents with COVID-like or communicable disease symptoms, especially if the symptoms, (cough, vomiting, diarrhea), that might be explained by overeating, overexertion, allergies, etc. it is important to isolate and observe the child for additional symptoms. Isolation can occur at the center as long as they are kept out of the general population. If symptoms worsen, then the child should be sent home. If symptoms resolve and can be explained away by one of the situations listed above, the child may return to the general population. In the event symptoms do not resolve or worsen, the child must be isolated until they are able to be picked up by a parent or guardian. Testing for COVID-19 is strongly recommended to verify the diagnosis of COVID-19. In the absence of testing, or if the child tests positive, they are to remain home and isolated for at least 10 days following their first symptom, plus 24 hours after fever resolves and when other symptoms are improving.It depends on whether there is a concern that the child was exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., a known exposure or close contact of someone who is positive for COVID-19) to the parent’s knowledge. If there is a high level of suspicion that the child had contact or was exposed to someone with COVID-19, they should be excluded for 10 days (isolation). If there is a low index of suspicion (not a close contact, no known exposure), and a clear alternative diagnosis from a healthcare provider, the child can return based on the childcare center's exclusion policy for fever. This is typically 24-48 hours.If there is a high level of suspicion that the child was exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., a known exposure or close contact of someone who is positive for COVID-19) they should wait the entire 10 days prior to returning to care even with a negative test result. If there is a low index of suspicion for COVID-19 (not a close contact, no known exposure), they can return according to the normal exclusion criteria for that symptom(s), e.g., for fever, 24 hours with no symptoms.While testing is highly recommended, a healthcare provider can provide a note with a clear alternative diagnosis and the child could come back 24 hours symptom-free or whatever the center’s exclusion is for their alternative condition/symptom. For example, if a child has a fever and is positive for strep, the provider may forgo COVID-19 testing since there is a likely diagnosis and the child could return to care based on the center’s strep exclusion. Notify and work with the health department to determine next steps and make decisions about closures.If someone is positive for COVID-19, they must stay isolated for 10 days from the first day they started having symptoms (or in the absence of symptoms, 10 days since the date they were tested) plus 24 hours fever-free and with having an improvement in symptoms.Child care centers, family child care homes, and building-based school-age programs. This does not apply for school-age day camps, license-exempt youth programs, or resident camps.There is nothing that prohibits field trips. However, all physical distancing requirements are required including keeping children 6 feet apart while transporting.Mats/cots should be placed 6 feet apart. It is recommended that children be spaced head to toe. Mats, cots and sheets should be stored and washed as you normally would.Staff should wear gloves as they normally would for activities such as diaper changing, handling body fluids, and handling ready to eat food. Gloves may also need to be worn when conducting screenings.Note:

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.On 7/16/2020 Governor Jared Polis issued a 
statewide mask order
, directing Coloradans to wear a face covering while indoors. We are currently seeking clarification from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) regarding some differences between the state and local orders. 
Keep an eye on our website for updates
.People who have the virus but do not have symptoms can spread the virus without knowing it. This can happen in two situations:The purpose of a cloth face covering is to protect others around you in case you have the virus but don't know it.
 Cloth face coverings should:Face coverings help to reduce air droplets that are breathed out onto others when we talk, sneeze or cough which may spread COVID-19 when someone doesn't know they have the virus.When out of your home in a setting where physical distancing is challenging, we strongly recommend wearing a face covering. Local businesses are required to make sure that everyone in their facility is wearing a face covering, including customers, unless they have implemented
 
additional physical distancing measures. May 3, 2020- Larimer County 
Face Coverings in Businesses Order
 May 30, 2020- 
Larimer County Amended Face Coverings OrderAlternative to Face Covering ChecklistOn 6/4/2020, Governor Polis issued 
Executive Order D 2020 092
 that allows businesses to deny service to customers who do not wear a mask in their facility.There is no need to wear a face-covering at your home or when you are doing something by yourself a minimum of 6 feet or more away from other people, such as walking your dog. This order does not apply to children under age two (2) or to those people for whom a face covering would cause harm due to an existing health condition. It also does not apply to those working in a location where they will not be within 6 feet of any other individuals or persons working in a professional office who do not have any face-to-face interactions with the public.These coverings should be made of homemade materials and be washable. According to 
coloradomaskproject.com
, all coverings should have:If you are sick, 
get tested
, stay home and self isolate, and 
report your symptoms on our self-reporting dashboard
. If your employer recommends the use of a face covering, refer to your agency’s policy/procedures for guidance. For more information about cloth face coverings from CDC, please visit 
their website
.It is not known if face shields provide any benefit as source control to protect others from the spray of respiratory particles. CDC does not recommend the use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings. 
Critical/essential workers cannot substitute a cloth face covering with a face shield
 but may wear a face shield with a face covering for additional protection.Some people may choose to use a face shield when sustained close contact with other people is expected. If face shields are used without a mask, they should wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin. Disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use. Reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use. 
Plastic face shields for newborns and infants are NOT recommended.Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators. Currently, those are critical supplies that should continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Cloth face coverings also are not appropriate substitutes for them in workplaces where masks or respirators are recommended or required and available.Absolutely. The distance and the mask together help provide extra protection when out in the community.If a business has a sign posted that states they require customers to wear masks, you must wear a mask unless you can not do so safely due to a medical condition.If a business has a sign that states they have implemented alternative safety measures and are not requiring customers to wear masks, you do not have to wear a mask, but we encourage you to do so. CDC recommends that everyone over age 2 wear a mask. We're asking that everyone do their best, but we recognize that many children won't tolerate having a mask on. Cloth face coverings or masks should be worn whenever you are visiting a local business or in close proximity to others outside of your household. See the Amended Face Covering Order for Larimer County here.There is no documentation required and you do not need to explain that you have a medical condition. The Health Department requires that businesses post signage and remind customers that they require masks, but businesses do not need to be confrontational. Businesses who do not want to enforce that customers wear face-coverings must implement 
alternative safety measures.  If wearing a mask poses a risk to your health, stay at home as much as possible.Cloth masks are available through a variety of venues. Many are simple and 
easy to make
 with supplies you might have at home, such as an old T-shirt. Friends and loved ones may be able to make some for you or they can be purchased online through online vendors and crafters.Cloth face coverings are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and don't know it from spreading it to others unknowingly. Cloth face coverings help keep respiratory droplets that are exhaled from getting onto others. The masks protect the people around you from you, not you from them.Medical grade masks, surgical masks, and N95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers or other medical first responders, as recommended by CDC guidance.We know how frustrating that is. Thank you for doing your part by wearing a face covering when you’re out. The state order requires that essential workers wear face coverings or masks. Local orders require that face coverings be worn by employees and customers in a business. Larimer County's Face-Covering order states that someone who can not wear a face-covering due to breathing difficulties or medical issues does not need to wear one.  Other customers and individuals should not become confrontational with other people for not wearing a mask. Do not call 911, the police, or the Sheriff’s Office to report someone not wearing a mask. It is not known if face shields provide any benefit to protect others from the spray of respiratory particles from the person wearing the shield. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for cloth face coverings. 
Critical/essential workers cannot substitute a cloth face covering with a face shield
 but may wear a face shield with a face covering for additional protection.Help fight COVID-19 by making fabric face coverings for our local essential workers. Homemade masks should be:Drop off homemade face coverings Monday-Friday between 8am and 4:30pm at:Note:

This includes:Those who might also be at increased risk include:Now that COVID-19 is present in our community, we recommend that those who are at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19 minimize their contact with people in the community outside of their immediate household. For more information and recommendations for those who are at higher risk, visit the 
CDC website
.Protecting Yourself and Your Loved Ones From COVID-19...through everyday actions...through physical distancing...by being preparedActivities are safer if you can maintain at least 6 feet of space between you and others, because COVID-19 spreads easier between people who are within 6 feet of each other. Indoor spaces with less ventilation where it might be harder to keep people apart are more risky than outdoor spaces. Interacting without wearing cloth face coverings also increases your risk. When deciding to participate in various activities, consider the level of risk that activity may carry for being exposed to COVID-19 or exposing others.The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:Before participating in an activity consider:Not everyone has a safe home to shelter in during this outbreak. Domestic violence and child abuse may increase as individuals experience increased stress while survivors and their abusers are sheltered together for long periods of time. With more individuals out of work or working remotely and with children not able to attend school, these forms of violence have fewer opportunities to be noticed and addressed. It is particularly important during this time to check in on friends and neighbors. Many services are still open and available to help those who are affected by interpersonal violence.ResourcesNote:

           AMENDED SEVENTH PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER 
 RE: FACE COVERINGS
 May 30, 2020
  This Public Health Order is issued pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. §25
-1-506, 508, 509, 516  
and other applicable authority. 
  
On March 10, 2020, the Governor of Colorado declared a State of Emergency related to the 
presence of COVID
-19 in the State. The Colo

-19.  On March 13, 2020, the President
 of the United States declared a National Emergency

On March 22, 2020, the Governor of the State of Colorado issued Executive Order 
D2020
-013 ordering non
-critical workplaces to reduce their in
-person workforce by 
50% and to implement t
elework capabilities to the greatest extent possible due to the

-19 in the state (ﬁMarch 22 Reduced Workforce EOﬂ).
  On March 22, 2020, the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and 

Environment, pursuant to Colorad
o Revised Statute §§ 25
-1.5
-101(1)(a) and 25

-102(1)(a)(I), also issued an order defining critical businesses and critical government

Reduced Workforce Orderﬂ).
  By March 25,

-at-Home orders were
 replaced with the statewide Safer
-at-Home orders.
  
On May 3rd, 2020 the Larimer County Public Health Director issued an order requiring 

masks to be worn inside businesses.
  
BASIS FOR ORDER
  The virus that causes Coronavirus 2019 (ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ) is easily transmitted, especially in 
group settings, and it is essential that the spread of the virus be slowed to protect the 

ability of public and private health care providers to handle the influx of new patients and 

safeguard public health and safet
y. This Order is necessary because of the risk of the rapid 

spread of the virus, and the need to protect all members of Larimer County, especially 
including our members most susceptible to the virus and also health care providers.
  This Order is issued bas
ed on scientific evidence and best practices regarding the most 
effective approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases generally and 
COVID
-19 specifically.  Due to the outbreak of the COVID
-19 virus in the general public, 
which is now a pan
demic according to the World Health Organization, there is a public 
health emergency throughout Larimer County and the State of Colorado.  
 
 
Making the problem worse, some individuals who contract the COVID
-19 virus have no 
symptoms or have mild symptoms, 
which means they may not be aware they carry the 

virus.  Because even people without symptoms can transmit the disease, and because 

evidence shows the disease is easily spread, gatherings can result in preventable 

transmission of the virus.  The scientific
 evidence shows that at this stage of the emergency, 
it is essential to slow virus transmission as much as possible to protect the most vulnerable 

and to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. 
  
              
One proven way to slow the transmission is for individuals to wear a mask or other facial 

covering.  The CDC recommends the widespread use of face coverings as a mechanism to 
slow the spread of COVID
-19.  The primary transmission of COVID
-19 is now known t
o be 
droplet
-based, and the transmission largely occurs in the first seven days after infection,

-at-Home orders were
 replaced with the statewide Safer
-at-Home orders.
  On May 3rd, 2020 the Larimer County Public Health Director issued an order requiring 
masks to be worn inside businesses.
  BASIS FOR ORDER
  The virus that causes Coronavirus 2019 (ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ) is easily transmitted, especially in 
group settings, and it is essential that the spread of the virus be slowed to protect the 
ability of public and private health care providers to handle the influx of new patients and 

safeguard public health and safet
y. This Order is necessary because of the risk of the rapid 
spread of the virus, and the need to protect all members of Larimer County, especially 
including our members most susceptible to the virus and also health care providers.
  
This Order is issued bas
ed on scientific evidence and best practices regarding the most 
effective approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases generally and 

COVID
-19 specifically.  Due to the outbreak of the COVID
-19 virus in the general public, 
which is now a pan
demic according to the World Health Organization, there is a public 

health emergency throughout Larimer County and the State of Colorado.  
 
 Making the problem worse, some individuals who contract the COVID
-19 virus have no 
symptoms or have mild symptoms, 
which means they may not be aware they carry the 
virus.  Because even people without symptoms can transmit the disease, and because 

evidence shows the disease is easily spread, gatherings can result in preventable 
transmission of the virus.  The scientific
 evidence shows that at this stage of the emergency, 
it is essential to slow virus transmission as much as possible to protect the most vulnerable 
and to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. 
               
 
One proven way to slow the transmission is for individuals to wear a mask or other facial 
covering.  The CDC recommends the widespread use of face coverings as a mechanism to 
slow the spread of COVID
-19.  The primary transmission of COVID
-19 is now known t
o be 
droplet
-based, and the transmission largely occurs in the first seven days after infection,
 when people are largely asymptomatic. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 
one in four people who are infected spread the virus while asymptomati
c. Face coverings, 
when combined with social distancing and other preventative measures, have been shown 

to significantly reduce person
-to-person transmission, especially during asymptomatic 
contact. 
  
The purpose of the mask order is to slow the spread of
 COVID
-19 and to protect citizens of 
the county.  This includes both residents accessing businesses and those employed and 

providing services and goods to the public.  Each business atmosphere is unique.  
  Businesses can choose to require face coverings f
or customers, or to implement approved 
alternative controls to protect their employees and customers such as plexiglass shielding 
at point of sale areas, one way aisles, extra sanitization of high touch surfaces, and clearly 

marking six foot separation for

Businesses will need to complete the Alternative to Face Covering checklist found on 
Larimer.org/health to describe the alternatives they have chosen and how they have been 

implemented before they can remove the face 
covering requirement.

Public Health Director has the duty to investigate and con

  I. ORDER:
  Effective May 3, 2020 at 12 p.m., 
  
All employees who come into contact with the public or other individuals are 
required to wear face c
overings beginning on May 2, 2020 and continuing until May 30, 
2020. 
 
 All individuals entering or in line to enter businesses including but not limited to in
-person retail services, personal services, critical businesses, curbside and takeout 
restaurants,
 must cover their nose and mouth by wearing a mask or other form of facial 
covering beginning on May 2, 2020 and continuing until May 30, 2020. 
  
 Facial Coverings or masks include medical grade masks (non

made of cloth, fabric, or othe
r soft or permeable material, without holes, that covers the 
nose and mouth and surrounding areas of the lower face. A Face Covering may be factory
-made, or may be handmade and improvised from ordinary household materials. The Face 

Covering should fit snug
ly but comfortably against the side of the face, include multiple 
layers of fabric, allow for breathing without restriction, and be able to be laundered and 
machine
-dried without damage or change to shape. Face Coverings need to cover the nose 
and mouth at
 all times and should remain in place until taken off safely. Due to the scarcity 
of medical grade masks, non
-medical grade masks are recommended for all non
-healthcare 
workers to allow medical grade masks to be saved for healthcare workers. 
             
 
 This o
rder does not apply to those individuals who have medical conditions which 
make wearing of a mask or covering a risk to their health or that will interfere with their

-at-Home Order until 
April 11,
 2020.
  On April 6, 2020 Governor Polis and the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of 
Public Health and Environment extended the statewide Stay
-at-Home Order until April 26 
2020.
  On April 7, 2020 the Larimer County Public Health Director extend
ed the Stay
-at-Home 
order until April 26, 2020.
  
On April 26, 2020 the statewide and countywide Stay
-at-Home 
orders will expire and be 
replaced with the state™s Safer
-at-Home orders, which Larimer County plans to adopt.
  The age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the population in the Estes Park 
area, specificall
y considering that the average age of residents is 55 years old, and because 
the COVID
-19 virus appears to disproportionately affect those of older age, places it at risk 
of serious health complications, including death, from COVID
-19. Although most indivi
duals 
who contract COVID
-19 do not become seriously ill, 
some persons with mild symptoms and 
asymptomatic persons with COVID
-19 may place other 
susceptible
 members of the public 
at significant risk.  A large surge in the number of persons with serious infe
ctions could 

compromise the capability of the healthcare system.
           
Visitation brings more people to the community, increases the likelihood of the rapid 

spread of the virus, and increases the risk to life and health in the Town and surrounding 
area.
  The Larimer County Department of Health and Environment has confirmed
 case
s of COVID
-19 in the Estes Park area.
  
The 
Larimer County Department of Health and Environment has encouraged the Town to 

limit visitor services in the Town and discourage visitation, in the memorandum attached 

as Exhibit A.
  
The Chief of Staff of Estes Park Health District, the Town™s hospital, ha
s also urged the 

Town to shut down hotels, motels, and vacation rentals to limit the number of tourists into 

the Town, in the letter attached as Exhibit B.
  This Order is adopted pursuant to the legal authority set forth in sections 25
-1-506, 
Colorado Revi
sed Statutes. Under this law, the Larimer County Public Health Director has 
the duty to investigate and control the causes of epidemic or communicable diseases and 
conditions affecting public health and to establish, maintain, and enforce isolation and 
qua
rantine, and in pursuance thereof, and for this purpose only, to exercise physical 
control over property and over the persons of the people within the jurisdiction of the 
agency as the agency may find necessary for the protection of the public health, and 
to 
close public places and to prohibit gatherings of people when necessary to protect public 

health.

  State public health order prohibits vacation 
 home rental operations 
 Larimer County, CO 
---
 After reaching out to the State of Colorado early this week, Larimer County 
Department of Health and Environment and the Town of Estes Park received clarification 
today from 
the State that its Public Health Order 20
-28 ﬁSafer at Homeﬂ prohibits the operation of Vacation 
Home Rentals for the duration of the order, April 27 through May 26. 
The reference is on page 27 
of the order at 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l13eSver8iS1fE149gmKHCLoHPgutNvO/view
 (available via 
https://covid19.colorado.gov/safer
-at-home
). 
 Under t
he state order, guests at vacation rental homes in the Estes Valley, and everywhere in 
Colorado, may not be accepted through May 26. Questions and concerns should be directed to 
the State using the form at 
https://covid19.colorado.gov/CovidConcerns
. The State™s order supersedes, for the time being, the aspects of the April 23 accommodations 
orders issued by Larimer County and the Town of Estes Park that allowed reopening of vacation 
home 
rentals in the Estes Valley. While non
-essential travel is still limited by request of the State 
and County, the primary purpose of these orders was to allow facilities to prepare for when 
travel becomes less restricted, and to serve essential travel or th
ose traveling within the county.
 The Town and County orders continue to apply to all other accommodations. Review the 
complete orders for the unincorporated Estes Valley at 
www.larimer.org/coronavirus
 and for 
Town limits at

.  Information about COVID
-19 is constantly changing, and the public health respon
se adjusts as 
more is learned about this virus. While there is plenty of news and media information available, 
LCDHE is encouraging Larimer County residents to view the latest credible information on 
COVID
-19 at www.larimer.org/coronavirus  or www.CDC.gov/

ceasing the operations and vacating the premises of all short
-term lodging in the Estes 
Valley.
  
On March 22, 2020, the Governor of the State of Colorado issued Execut
ive Order 
D2020
-013 ordering non

presence of COVID
-19 in the state (ﬁMarch 22 Reduced Workforce EOﬂ).
  
On March

-1.5
-101(1)(a) and 25

   I.  BASIS FOR ORDER
  
The virus that causes Coronavirus 2019 (ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ) is easily transmitted, especially in 
group settings, and it is essential that the spread of the virus be slowed to protect the 
             
ability of the Community Corrections Facility to appropriately function and m
aintain 
security.
  
Allowing residents to continue to go into the community and return to the facility increases 

the risk of an outbreak in the facility and compromises the ability of the facility to maintain 

the health and safety of the residents, as well 
as the security of the facility.
  
This Order is adopted pursuant to the legal authority set forth in sections 25
-1-506, 
Colorado Revised Statutes. Under this law, the Larimer County Public Health Director has 

the duty to investigate and control the causes 
of epidemic or communicable diseases and 
conditions affecting public health and to establish, maintain, and enforce isolation and 

quarantine, and in pursuance thereof, and for this purpose only, to exercise physical 

control over property and over the perso
ns of the people within the jurisdiction of the 
agency as the agency may find necessary for the protection of the public health, and to 

close public places and to prohibit gatherings of people when necessary to protect public 
health.
   I. ORDER:
  
The Order p
reviously issued related to the Community Corrections Facility not 
allowing residents to go into the community is hereby extended until May 15, 2020.

 Given the rapid rise of the COVID
-19 virus, and taking into consideration the limitations of 
the Larimer County work release facility and the staff, and given the difficulty to 

accomplish proper social distancing, and the isolation and medical care of symptomatic 
individuals in this facility,  there is a need to balance public safety and the public health of

Home Order until April 26

I.
 
 
BASIS FOR ORDER
 
 
The virus that causes Coronavirus 2

-

group settings, and it is essential that the spread of the virus be slowed to protect the 
ability of public and private health care providers to handle the influx of new patients and 
safeguard public he
alth and safety. This Order is necessary because of the risk of the rapid 
spread of the virus, and the need to protect all members of Larimer County, especially 
including our members most susceptible to the virus and also health care providers.
 
 
This Order
 
is issued based on evidence of increasing occurrence of COVID
-
19 within 
Larimer County, scientific evidence and best practices regarding the most effective 
approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases generally and COVID
-
19 
specifically, a
nd evidence that the age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the 
population of Larimer County places it at risk for serious health complications, including 
death, from COVID
-
19.  Due to the outbreak of the COVID
-
19 virus in the general publi
c, 
which is now a pandemic according to the World Health Organization, there is a public 
health emergency throughout Larimer County and the State of Colorado.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Making the problem worse, some individuals who contract the COVID
-
19 virus have no 
sympto
ms or have mild symptoms, which means they may not be aware they carry the 
virus.  Because even people without symptoms can transmit the disease, and because 
evidence shows the disease is easily spread, gatherings can result in preventable 
transmission of 
the virus.  The scientific evidence shows that at this stage of the emergency, 
it is essential to slow virus transmission as much as possible to protect the most vulnerable 
and to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. 
 
 
One proven way to 
slow the transmission is to limit interactions among people to the 
greatest extent practicable.  By reducing the spread of the COVID
-
19 virus, this Order helps 
preserve critical and limited healthcare capacity in Larimer County.
 
 
Larimer County Officials e
stimate transmission has already been reduced based on 
previous measures taken in Larimer County and Colorado, such as closing restaurants and 
bars for dine
-
in service, halting personal services in hair salons and spas, and bans on 
gatherings of ten or mor
e individuals.  If no further measures were taken, Larimer County 
officials believe it could take months to slow the spread of transmission in the community.
 
 
The extension of the Stay
-
at
-
Home order, which directs the community to only leave the 
house for 
food and essential services, is because officials believe they could achieve a 
substantial decrease in transmission. The Stay
-
at
-
Home order can help dramatically 
decrease the length of restrictions in our community. 
 
 
This Order is adopted pursuant to the 
legal authority set forth in sections 25
-
1
-
506, 
Colorado Revised Statutes and other applicable law.  Under this law, the Larimer County 
Public Health Director has the duty to investigate and control the causes of epidemic or 
communicable diseases and condi
tions affecting public health and to establish, maintain, 
and enforce isolation and quarantine, and in pursuance thereof, and for this purpose only, 
to exercise physical control over property and over the persons of the people within the 
jurisdiction of th
e agency as the agency may find necessary for the protection of the public 
health, and to close public places and to prohibit gatherings of people when necessary to 
protect public health.
 
 
The intent of this Order is to ensure that the maximum number of pe
ople self
-
isolate in 
their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible to slow the spread of COVID
-
19 to 
the greatest extent possible, while enabling the continuation of essential services, 
businesses and travel necessary to protect public health an
d safety, and for the continuity 
of social and commercial life.

lthough most individuals 
who contract COVID
-
19 do not become seriously ill,  some persons with mild symptoms

s with serious infections 
could compromise the capability of the healthcare system.

50% and to implement telework capabilities to the greatest extent possible due to the 

presence of COVID
-19 in the state (ﬁMarch 22 Reduced Workforce EOﬂ).
  
On March 22, 2020, the Executive Director of the Colorado Department
 of Public Health and 
Environment, pursuant to Colorado Revised Statute §§ 25
-1.5
-101(1)(a) and 25
-1.5
-102(1)(a)(I), also issued an order defining critical businesses and critical government 

functions that are exempt from the directives of EO D2020
-013 (ﬁM
arch 22 CDPHE 
Reduced Workforce Orderﬂ).
  By March 25, 2020 various jurisdictions around Colorado have issued stay
-at-home orders 
including: the City and County of Denver, and Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Douglas, and 
Jefferson Counties.  
  I.  BASIS FOR ORDER
  The virus that causes Coronavirus 2019 (ﬁCOVID
-19ﬂ) is easily transmitted, especially in 
group settings, and it is essential that the spread of the virus be slowed to protect the 
ability of public and private health care providers to handle the influx of n
ew patients and 
safeguard public health and safety. This Order is necessary because of the risk of the rapid 

spread of the virus, and the need to protect all members of Larimer County, especially 

including our members most susceptible to the virus and also
 health care providers.
  
This Order is issued based on evidence of increasing occurrence of COVID
-19 within 
Larimer County, scientific evidence and best practices regarding the most effective 

approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases gen
erally and COVID
-19 specifically, and evidence that the age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the 

population of Larimer County places it at risk for serious health complications, including 

death, from COVID
-19.  Due to the outbreak of the 
COVID
-19 virus in the general public, 
which is now a pandemic according to the World Health Organization, there is a public 

health emergency throughout Larimer County and the State of Colorado.  
  Making the problem worse, some individuals who contract the
 COVID
-19 virus have no 
symptoms or have mild symptoms, which means they may not be aware they carry the 

virus.  Because even people without symptoms can transmit the disease, and because 
evidence shows the disease is easily spread, gatherings can result i
n preventable 
transmission of the virus.  The scientific evidence shows that at this stage of the emergency, 

it is essential to slow virus transmission as much as possible to protect the most vulnerable 

and to prevent the health care system from being over
whelmed. 
            
One proven way to slow the transmission is to limit interactions among people to the 

greatest extent practicable.  By reducing the spread of the COVID
-19 virus, this Order helps 
preserve critical and limited healthcare capacity in Larimer Co
unty.
  
Larimer County Officials estimate transmission has already been reduced based on 

previous measures taken in Larimer County and Colorado, such as closing restaurants and 
bars for dine
-in service, halting personal services in hair salons and spas, and
 bans on 
gatherings of ten or more individuals.  If no further measures were taken, Larimer County 
officials believe it could take months to slow the spread of transmission in the community.
  The addition of a Stay
-at-Home order, which directs the community to only leave the house 
for food and essential services, officials believe they could achieve a substantial decrease in 
transmission. A Stay
-at-Home order now can help dramatically decrease 
the length of 
restrictions in our community. 
 
 This Order is adopted pursuant to the legal authority set forth in sections 25
-1-506, 
Colorado Revised Statutes and other applicable law.  Under this law, the Larimer County 
Public Health Director has the duty
 to investigate and control the causes of epidemic or 
communicable diseases and conditions affecting public health and to establish, maintain, 
and enforce isolation and quarantine, and in pursuance thereof, and for this purpose only, 
to exercise physical c
ontrol over property and over the persons of the people within the 
jurisdiction of the agency as the agency may find necessary for the protection of the public 

health, and to close public places and to prohibit gatherings of people when necessary to 
protec
t public health.
  The intent of this Order is to ensure that the maximum number of people self
-isolate in 
their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible to slow the spread of COVID
-19 to 
the greatest extent possible, while enabling the continuati
on of essential services, 

businesses and travel necessary to protect public health and safety, and for the continuity 

of social and commercial life.
  I. ORDER:

      MEMORANDUM
  TO:
  Travis Machalek
 FROM:
 Tom Gonzales, MPH, 
Larimer County 
Public Health Director
  DATE:
 March 19, 2019
 RE:
 COVID
-19 Recommendations for Estes Park
  We now have a confirmed case in Estes Park. I urge the Town to limit access to visitor services 
and encourag
e visitors to not travel through Larimer County and up to Estes Park.  The Public 
Health Order strictly prohibits any gathering of 10 or people, a
nd further urges susceptible 
people (60 or great underlying health conditions) maintain 6 f
eet from people.  
  
As COVID
-19 move
s through the country and across Colorado, we expect to continue to have 
cases in Larimer County. Testing is limited an
d results are delayed, so we assume that we have 
far more positive cases in our community then the data shows.
  
 
    Tom Gonzales, MPH 
 Public Health Director
    To 
Estes Park Town 
Administrator Travis Machalek, May
or J
irs
a, and the Town Board of Trustee
s,  
Although Rocky Mountain National is vast, the Town of Estes Park itself is small and health care 
resources are limited. 
We are using our available resources to take care of the health care needs of 
the 
Estes Valley
 Community, 65% of which 
are over age 65 a
nd 
are at risk for COVID
-19. We
™re
 also 
prioritizing
 the health care needs of our Estes Park Health staff. 
   I am urging people not to visit
 Estes Park
. The best thing 
any of us can
 do is stay at home
. I do not
 think 
this is the time to encourage people to take cross
-country road trips
, even though the Nat
ional Parks 
are free right now.
  This 
statement
 come
s in response to 
the CDCs ﬁ15 Days
 to Slow the Spreadﬂ campaign. "
The CDC 
encourages everyone
 to 
AVOID discretionary travel
, shopping trips and social visits."
  Similarly, the Center for Disease Control 
updated its guide
lines
 recently
 to recommend all events with 
more than 
10 attendees be cancelled or postponed for the next eight weeks. Although visiting national 
parks like 
Rocky Mountain National Park
 doesn™t require directly interacting with many people, 
the 
people that
 go there pass though our town in great numbers.
   My strong concern is that 
the encourag
ement to visit National Parks
 for free
, includin
g Rocky Mountain 
National Park 
could 
significantly 
increase 
the 
uptick 
of
 this viral illness
 in our community
. I urge the 
Federal Government
 to change their stance 
and to
 shut down National Parks, including 
Rocky 
Mountain National Park
. The downstream effects of flooding this town with tourists is not something 
that E
stes
 Park Health, or any smal
l hospitals 
in this country
, are prepared to handle at this time. 
  
We need to focus on the citizens of the Estes Park Valley
 and Estes Park Health
, first and foremost. 
 Estes Park Health is
 currently
 dea
ling
 with 
the heal
th care needs of our community. 
Believe me, I am all 
for getting outside during these times, but the
 spread 
of 
the
 virus
 unwittingly by allowing free national 
park tourism will inevitably lead to the unwanted taxing of 
Estes Park Health resources
.  In add
ition to urging Rocky Mountain National Park to shut down, 
I also
 urge Larimer County
 and/or 
the Town of Estes Park
 to shut down non
-essential services including hotels
, motels, and vacation 
rentals 
to limit the nu
mber of tourists into our town.
    Estes P
ark Health has established a COVID
-19 Hotline: 970
-577-4400 to answer our community™s 
questions and concerns. Eph.org also has a landing page with community information and resources 
from our trusted resources at the CDC, Colorado Department of Public Heal

  State public health order prohibits vacation 
 home rental operations 
 Larimer County, CO 
---
 After reaching out to the State of Colorado early this week, Larimer County 
Department of Health and Environment and the Town of Estes Park received clarification 
today from 
the State that its Public Health Order 20
-28 ﬁSafer at Homeﬂ prohibits the operation of Vacation 
Home Rentals for the duration of the order, April 27 through May 26. 
The reference is on page 27 
of the order at 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l13eSver8iS1fE149gmKHCLoHPgutNvO/view
 (available via 
https://covid19.colorado.gov/safer
-at-home
). 
 Under t
he state order, guests at vacation rental homes in the Estes Valley, and everywhere in 
Colorado, may not be accepted through May 26. Questions and concerns should be directed to 
the State using the form at 
https://covid19.colorado.gov/CovidConcerns
. The State™s order supersedes, for the time being, the aspects of the April 23 accommodations 
orders issued by Larimer County and the Town of Estes Park that allowed reopening of vacation 
home 
rentals in the Estes Valley. While non
-essential travel is still limited by request of the State

notified in writing
 by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment that the uptick in daily case counts in Larimer County has put the variance at risk. Many of these cases are connected to fourth of July gatherings. Larimer County is required to create a mitigation plan to show how the county will decrease and stabilize case counts. This plan must be completed by Monday and requires strong community enforcement and compliance plans for face coverings, social distancing, and following the required guidelines for businesses.

. The state has not approved this yet so it is subject to change. A revocation of the variance could potentially impact our restaurants and breweries, places of worship, public gathering sizes and graduations. It is always the hope of LCDHE that there is no rollback and that businesses are not closed again in Larimer County, but the revocation of the local variance from the state would not give the county a choice. Face coverings, social distancing, handwashing and frequent cleaning all help slow the spread of the virus in the community. Through our contact tracing, we are learning that much of the spread is connected to large gatherings.  Recently, residents have become less cautious, and are not following the guidance in Larimer County. Cases have continued to rise to reflect that. “Together Larimer County successfully reduced cases back in May and June, and our response has been a model for the state,” says Tom Gonzales, Public Health Director for Larimer County. “I know that we will regroup and reverse this uptick. But in order to do that, we must all take this seriously and be diligent with handwashing, face coverings and social distancing. We must slow our case count to keep our businesses open.  I am confident we will overcome this challenge.”Larimer County has two weeks to reverse the trend of increasing cases, or the variance could be modified or revoked based on the case count and percent testing positive. Public Health can’t do this alone. It takes community partners, municipalities, business owners and residents to step up the response to COVID-19 and take this seriously. Information about COVID-19 is constantly changing, and the public health response adjusts as more is learned about this virus.

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.As statewide Safer at Home restrictions are relaxed, the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment and the Town of Estes Park will allow local public health orders limiting the operations of Estes Valley lodging facilities to expire May 31. Beginning June 1, lodging facilities may operate following the required guidance and restrictions set forth by Larimer County and the State of Colorado. A checklist for lodging properties is available at 
www.larimer.org/variance
 under “short term rentals.”As provided by the variance Larimer County received from the State of Colorado, short-term vacation home rentals may now operate with a plan to monitor and follow the new guidance from 
www.larimer.org/variance
: Private, short-term vacation-style rentals such as those arranged through an online hosting platform, including but not limited to VRBO or Airbnb, homeowner rentals, and privately owned residences for rent that are rented for a period of 30 days or fewer are permitted to operate. Guests should be informed of local restrictions due to COVID-19 prior to arrival; restaurants may only be offering take-out or require reservations, face covering requirements or local closures of recreation facilities. Owners of short term rental properties must provide visitors access to cleaning supplies, such as disposable wipes, to clean doorknobs, remote controls, and desks before and after each use.Groups larger than 10, except those all from the same household, are not permitted. (Guests are limited to 8 for stays through May 31)Town Administrator Travis Machalek commented, “Our state and county have made great strides in reducing the spread of COVID-19 while increasing medical resources. Now that the State of Colorado has now loosened travel restrictions and Rocky Mountain National Park has opened, we want our lodging properties to be able to operate to the full extent allowed by the public health experts.”  “Larimer County has done a great job on flattening the curve by decreasing the number of hospitalizations, and ICU utilizations, unfortunately the curve does not go away,” says Public Health Director Tom Gonzales. “We need to continue to be diligent wearing our face coverings, social distancing, handwashing and cleaning frequently to continue slowing the spread of the virus. Information about COVID-19 is constantly changing, and the public health response adjusts as more is learned about this virus.

Businesses allowed to re-open or expand have additional protocols and requirements to meet in order to continue the re-opening process. If at any time it is determined that Larimer County hospitals are experiencing any type of capacity issues related to COVID-19, the county would need to tighten restrictions again.Larimer County residents have done a great job flattening the curve. Face coverings, social distancing, handwashing and frequent cleaning all help slow the spread of the virus in the community. Those precautions must continue in order to allow Larimer County to move forward with reopening businesses as safer at home restrictions are lifted.Specific details on what was approved and what the restrictions are can be found at larimer.org/variance. Businesses are required to complete checklists to be allowed to re-open or submit plans for approval, depending on the industry or sector.“We are pleased that the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment has approved these requests and that our community can continue taking a measured approach to reopening. We've appreciated the opportunity to work with local businesses to find innovative and creative ways to resume services carefully,” says Tom Gonzales, Public Health Director for Larimer County. “The health department will continue to collaborate with our hospitals daily to monitor capacity triggers and are confident that we can slowly reopen business ahead of the statewide safer at home restrictions.”As part of this process, early warning indicators have been developed to help monitor the health of the hospital systems related to COVID-19. As restrictions continue to be lifted, early warning indicators will be closely monitored to make sure reopening businesses is not causing a strain on local hospital systems.

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.Larimer County Public Health has amended the public health order requiring face coverings for employees and customers to enter businesses in Larimer County. Larimer County continues to work with local businesses to develop creative mechanisms to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus as part of the overall goal of keeping County businesses and residents safe and as operational as possible.Businesses will have to continue to require face coverings for customers and employees, or businesses can decide to complete the additional social distancing checklist and put stricter requirements in place. If businesses cannot meet all of the additional requirements they must continue to require face coverings. The option to implement alternative prevention measures is meant as an additional way to provide for the safety of businesses, employees, and customers. Businesses can choose to continue to require face coverings for customers, or to implement additional alternative controls to protect their employees and customers such as plexiglass shielding at point of sale areas, one way aisles, extra sanitization of high touch surfaces, and clearly marking six foot separation for customers in areas where lines form. The full required checklist can be found at larimer.org/coronavirus. Employees are still required to wear face coverings or masks at all times when interacting with customers and other employees. It is still protocol that if the Health Department determines that an outbreak of COVID-19 is traceable to a particular business, the business may be required to close for a period of time to clean and disinfect the facilities and for additional contact tracing.Businesses in the personal services category will not have the option to opt out of using face coverings because the state safer-at-home order strictly requires these for employees and customers due to the nature of the services being provided, and inability to employ physical distancing.The CDC and the US Surgeon General recommends the widespread use of face coverings as a mechanism to slow the spread of COVID-19. The CDC recommends that children over the age of two wear face coverings when possible.  The primary transmission of COVID-19 is now known to be by respiratory droplets, and the transmission largely occurs in the first seven days after infection, when people are largely asymptomatic.  Face coverings work by reducing the release of infectious droplets into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes, including someone who has the virus yet feels well. “We are hearing from our businesses that they have found creative options to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets containing the virus, protecting both employees and customers.,” says Tom Gonzales, Public Health Director for Larimer County. “Face coverings are one part of slowing the spread of the virus. Social distancing is also a key part in keeping COVID-19 cases low in our community.”

Face coverings, social distancing, handwashing and frequent cleaning all help slow the spread of the virus in the community. Those precautions must continue in order to allow Larimer County to move forward with reopening businesses as safer at home restrictions are lifted. The next step is for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to review and approve some or all of the variance submitted by Larimer County. Once approvals have been determined, the health department will be working with businesses on next steps to safely reopen. Counties are allowed to submit for a variance to the statewide safer at home orders certifying that the county can document the following criteria:The application must include a COVID-19 suppression plan approved by the local public health agency, all hospitals within the county and a majority of county commissioners. Local businesses want to reopen safely and thoughtfully, and this variance process allows Larimer County to continue that process. “All the public health measures and sacrifices we have taken in Larimer County have been successful in flattening the curve by decreasing the number of deaths, hospitalizations, and ICU utilizations, unfortunately the curve does not go away,” says Tom Gonzales, Public Health Director for Larimer County. “The health department will continue to collaborate with our hospitals daily to monitor capacity triggers and are pleased that we can slowly reopen business ahead of the statewide safer at home restrictions”As part of the suppression plan, early warning indicators have been developed to help monitor the health of the hospital systems related to COVID-19.

Suppression plans are part of the requirements for counties to be able to continue to move forward with slowly re-opening businesses. It is a requirement that local hospitals approve the suppression plan.  Hospitals also need to verify that they have the capacity to serve all people needing their care.  Many local agencies have chosen to extend stay at home orders, but Larimer County Public Health chose to follow the state’s orders and move into the safer at home phase. This decision was based on the continued efforts from the community to reduce the medical surge on hospitals. These efforts include strict social distancing, wearing face coverings and following stay at home orders. The safer at home phase continues protective measures such as social distancing of 6 feet or more, face coverings, and limiting groups less than 10 people to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community. The impacts of this safer at home order will not be known for up to 14-days since that is the outermost time for COVID-19 symptoms to fully present from the lifting of the stay at home order. “It is very important that we slowly step down on these restrictions so we do not cause a surge on the hospitals,” says Tom Gonzales, Larimer County Public Health Director. “We’re looking forward to working with our businesses to help them continue re-opening in the next few weeks.”  Larimer County is one week into the safer at home phase. This proposed suppression plan provides information on how Larimer County intends to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19 as restrictions continue to be lifted. Larimer County response actions to ensure suppression of COVID-19 include:Early warning indicators are also being identified as triggers in case it proves necessary to reinstate stay at home measures.  Larimer County indicators include:The suppression plan and early warning indicators are being created in partnership with our hospital systems. This plan will help the health department safely move forward as businesses in Larimer County re-opens.  You can help slow the spread of viruses by:Information about COVID-19 is constantly changing, and the public health response adjusts as more is learned about this virus.

All individuals entering or in line to enter businesses must cover their nose and mouth by wearing a mask or other form of facial covering. Businesses include but are not limited to schools, recreational facilities, retail businesses, manufacturing, places of worship, and personal service establishments. The public health order requires face coverings for anyone over two years old. Anyone who has an underlying health condition is at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 and should remain at home during this safer at home phase. Larimer County residents have done a great job flattening the curve and it is important to keep up the social distancing and face covering requirements. These measures can help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community and help Larimer county move to the next phase of COVID-19 response. The CDC recommends the widespread use of face coverings as a mechanism to slow the spread of COVID-19.  The primary transmission of COVID-19 is now known to be by respiratory droplets, and the transmission largely occurs in the first seven days after infection, when people are largely asymptomatic.“Our businesses have done a great job keeping their employees in face coverings to protect customers.

We have done a great job reducing the curve and keeping our case counts low. We must continue that great work, maintaining our social distances of 6 feet, wearing face coverings whenever we are in public near other people, and keeping gatherings to 10 people or less.“We need to be cautious with this move to the safer at home order. We don’t want to move too fast and see COVID-19 cases surge in our hospitals. We work closely with our hospitals and they will help us determine if we are moving too fast in this next phase, says Tom Gonzales, Public Health Director for Larimer County. “Physical distancing of 6 feet or more and face coverings in public should help us keep spread in our community low.”Many businesses have been closed in our community, and need time to get up and running again. The guidelines given still only allow them to operate in a limited capacity for this first phase. We need to balance the safety of our community with the need to slowly allow businesses to re-open. With any governor or state order, local public health agencies can be more restrictive but not less restrictive in their orders and guidance.There are some areas, like the Estes Valley, that will be more closely monitored. While travel is still not encouraged, accommodations are being allowed to re-open on a limited basis after being closed through a local order. This is to help them get ready for business in this new limited capacity and not to encourage a resurgence of travel to the area.The safer at home orders are the first step to re-opening the business community, but this is not a mandatory reopening. Businesses can choose to remain closed at this time as well.  Susceptible individuals and those with underlying health conditions are still being asked to remain home at this time.You can help slow the spread of viruses by:Information about COVID-19 is constantly changing, and the public health response adjusts as more is learned about this virus.

The County has received a delivery of limited testing supplies from the state. Testing will be provided until supplies are gone. Patients must be symptomatic. Testing will be done on an appointment basis, with pre-registration required. A doctor’s note is not required. No one under the age of 18 will be tested. Individuals are still recommended to contact their healthcare provider for guidance and assistance in acquiring a test, as some local providers have their own testing available to their clients. “Testing is key to start lifting our stay at home orders and move on to the safer at home stage,” said Tom Gonzales, Larimer County Director of Health and Environment. “We need to open slowly, and we need to have testing in place so that we can monitor the spread of COVID-19 in our community. We need to be testing every person who is symptomatic within 24 hours and issuing an isolation order within 6 hours of a positive reported case.”To register for COVID-19 testing through Larimer County, visit larimer.org/community-testingInformation about COVID-19 is constantly changing, and the public health response adjusts as more is learned about this virus.

The orders were issued March 21 and will be extended through April 26, aligning with the current stay-at-home orders. The age and health of a significant portion of the population in Estes Park places it at risk of serious health complications from COVID-19. Although most individuals who contract COVID-19 do not become seriously ill, people with mild symptoms and asymptomatic persons with COVID-19 may place other vulnerable members of the public at significant risk.The Larimer County Department of Health and Environment and the Town of Estes Park are limiting visitor services in the Town and discouraging visitation. The town’s hospital has also urged the Town to shut down hotels, motels, and vacation rentals to limit the number of tourists into the town. The orders from the Town and Larimer County limit accommodations in the Estes Park area. These orders went into effect on March 23 at 12 p.m. and now remain in effect through April 26, 2020. There are exceptions for local workers, long-term residents of short-term facilities, and those who are ill or quarantined. The complete orders may be viewed at

The ACS is tentatively set to be operated at The Ranch Events Complex in Loveland. Once a formal agreement is finalized and signed, additional details about the site will be released. This site is one of many that are being considered around Colorado by the Army Corp of Engineers. The site could serve as an overflow medical care facility for area and state residents. “It is a huge benefit to have the ability to relieve pressure on the regional hospitals,” said Steve Johnson, Chairman of the Larimer County Board of Commissioners. Hospitals in Larimer County, and the larger northern Colorado region, could reach capacity in the upcoming weeks and months. Based on the experiences of other communities across the country and the world, the County is preparing now to help the hospital systems when that time comes. Officials believe the ACS at The Ranch will not be an intake location. Residents in northern Colorado will still need to follow their regular medical processes. If individuals are experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19 they need to immediately isolate themselves and contact their medical provider for further instruction. Anyone experiencing life-threatening symptoms, please call 9-1-1 immediately. More information on home care and testing information can be found at larimer.org/coronavirus. Larimer County will continue to work on alternative plans for an ACS should the parties not be able to reach an agreement.Katie O'Donnell

Two of these deaths are epidemiologically linked cases, which means there was a possible connection to a COVID-19 case but testing was never completed. The other three deaths are confirmed COVID-19 patients.  All five individuals were over the age of sixty.Due to different ways of collecting data, sometimes LCDHE numbers do not align directly with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. This can be related to how deaths are reported and also that local information is sometimes more quickly available than state data.“We knew we would have deaths associated with COVID-19 in our community, but that doesn’t make this any easier. Our hearts go out to the families that are so personally impacted by COVID-19 in Larimer County,” Tom Gonzales, Larimer County Public Health Director. “We know that strict stay-at-home orders slow the spread of the virus. I urge everyone to follow Larimer County's stay-at-home order. Staying home will save lives.”Larimer County currently has 101 cases of confirmed COVID-19 individuals. With extremely minimal testing, LCDHE knows there are many more positive COVID-19 cases in Larimer County than the confirmed testing shows. You can help slow the spread of viruses by:Information about COVID-19 is constantly changing, and the public health response adjusts as more is learned about this virus.

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.This is a strange time in our community, in our state, in our world. COVID-19 has taken away our sense of normalcy, our routines, our freedom. This novel virus has caused disruptions like most of us have never experienced.Why is COVID-19 so different? Isn’t it too early to think we’ll be hit like other countries? Can’t we just wait and see?While some people are hospitalized and severely sick from COVID-19, many aren’t.

COVID-19 has a slower on-set than other viruses - this time is commonly called the incubation period.  Unlike the flu that hits quickly and keeps people at home, COVID-19 starts slowly. Symptoms are often mild, sometimes a low fever, cough, sore throat. Not enough to make most people think they need to stay home. That means people are out in the community not feeling all that bad and not realizing that they are spreading the virus to others.  This is often referred to as a “silent infection.” Some may experience no symptoms at all.  Others are showing symptoms that lead to shortness of breath and severe pneumonia.We must learn from other countries who are ahead of us on this virus spread. We’ve seen that social distancing helps slow the spread of this virus. We also know we need to keep people out of the hospitals, in preparation for beds filling up with COVID-19 related patients. We’ve seen that strict stay-at-home orders slow the spread of the virus. I urge everyone to follow this stay-at-home order. Even if you work in an essential service area, please delay what you can or move to remote options. Minimize your contact with others. And stay home. This isn’t a time to justify why you should be out or why your business needs to stay open. This is a time to stay home. Social distancing is the only tool we currently have available to fight the virus. There isn’t a vaccine, or even a treatment for COVID-19. With testing so limited, we believe there are far more COVID-19 cases in our community than the data shows.As your Public Health Director, I’m asking you to please take these restrictions seriously. When you go out for an essential service or an outdoor activity, keep 6 feet of distance between everyone. It will help us protect our community. Remember, people may be spreading the virus while showing no symptoms. The faster we flatten the curve, the faster these restrictions can be removed. Especially during this time, we need our friends, family and neighbors more than ever. For now, check in remotely. Hopefully, soon, we can check on them in person again. Our community is what is going to get us through this, and I appreciate you all coming together to support each other.For now, stay at home. Stay healthy. Stop the spread.   Click a photo to enlarge.Katie O'Donnell

The Larimer County Department of Health and Environment (LCDHE) knows that while more susceptible populations have more complications from COVID-19, other age ranges are also getting sick and some are hospitalized.Testing capacity in Colorado is limited, but the current results for Larimer County confirm that COVID-19 is affecting more than just our population over 60 years old.69% of cases in Larimer County are younger than 60 -

When people go out for essential services, physical (social) distancing is key. Remind children that although they might not get terribly sick from COVID-19, they can spread the virus to family members and close contacts that can’t fight the virus as well. It takes the whole community doing their part to slow the transfer of the virus in Larimer County. “I am pleading with our residents to follow strict physical distancing and stay home if it's not essential. Social distancing is 6 feet from others at all times. The sooner we take these dramatic measures, the sooner we will be able to resume normal activity,” said Tom Gonzales, Larimer County Public Health Director.  You can help slow the spread of viruses by:●          increasing distance between people to six feet to help reduce spread,●          washing hands frequently with soap and water,●          covering coughs and sneezes,●          staying home.Information about COVID-19 is constantly changing, and the public health response adjusts as more is learned about this virus.

A Stay-at-Home order now can help dramatically decrease the length of restrictions in our community. “We are certain that the sooner we take these dramatic measures, the sooner we will be able to resume normal activity.  But we need all residents of Larimer County to come together and do this for the sake of their friends, family and the community as a whole,” said Gonzales.  “Your actions at this moment will save lives and reduce the economic impact of this crisis on our community.”Larimer County has identified and defined essential activities, businesses and infrastructure.  These definitions and other information about the Stay-At-Home order are available at larimer.org/health/stay-at-home-orderCOVID-19 is spread like the flu.

The facility also has a staff person who tested positive for COVID-19. Due to the high-risk nature of residents in the facility, a team of infection preventionists and epidemiologists from CDC and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) have been working closely with LCDHE and providing on-site technical assistance and support regarding case investigation, infection prevention, healthcare worker safety assessments, and personal protective equipment.The resident and the worker who tested positive live/work at the North Shore Health & Rehab Facility in Loveland. While local public health agencies typically don’t release names of facilities, Columbine Health Systems, which operates North Shore Health & Rehab, has volunteered to share that information to help protect public health and keep people safe. The case investigation is ongoing, but to date there are no other confirmed cases associated with residents of this facility.  At least six other residents of the facility have been tested, and their test results were negative. Additional tests are pending.Case investigation is in process to identify people who have been in close contact with the individuals who tested positive so that public health workers can reach out to those contacts in the next few days. As with any communicable disease, this case investigation will take some time to complete. In order to protect the privacy of the individuals, identifying information and medical records will not be released to the public. “Columbine Health Systems has been a strong partner with local public health, state health and the CDC, doing everything they can to reduce the spread of this virus.” says Tom Gonzales, MPH, Larimer County Public Health Director.  “We continue to follow guidance from the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment, in partnership with the CDC and their infection control guidelines regarding COVID 19 testing and isolation procedures.

This means avoiding events, gatherings, and public places and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet) from others when possible.”Larimer County officials also want to stress that it is their intent to keep all essential services open, including gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies, medical centers, and parks. However, increased restrictions may be required.Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith stated, “Our community plays the most important role in this response. Officials are asking the community for voluntary compliance on the social distancing recommendations as well as with public health mandates to avoid a strain on public safety resources. We understand that these measures can be challenging. However, self-regulation is critical to reducing the likelihood of more restrictive measures being needed in the future.”Larimer County has issued guidance regarding social distancing, cleaning, and disinfection for: Lori Hodges, the Larimer Director of Emergency Management added, “With every community member doing their part and following direction from our public health experts, we will be better able to meet our community’s essential needs as this event unfolds.” More information regarding COVID-19 in Larimer County can be found at larimer.org/health.

 will come in handy when you have more than ten results.Larimer County Department of Health and Environment (LCDHE) has learned of a positive COVID-19 test result for the Weld county case connected to the Larimer County presumptive positive case. While Larimer County still only has one presumptive positive case, we expect to see an increase in positive test results over the next few days. Both individuals are employed by health care systems in Larimer and Weld county. Case investigation is in process; and identified close contacts will be contacted in the next few days. As with any communicable disease, this case investigation will take us some time to complete. In order to protect the privacy of the individual, identifying information and medical records will not be released to the public. Presumptive positive means that Colorado’s testing lab returned a positive result for COVID-19. All positive tests must be sent to CDC for official confirmation. That confirmation is pending, but it does not slow down the public health response. “We understand that this can be a scary time. At this point we are encouraging people to start social distancing. Please be aware that although COVID-19 doesn’t severely impact most individuals who contract it, it will impact our older adults (60 years and older) and those with underlying health issues more severely.” says Tom Gonzales, MPH, Public Health Director. “Social distancing can help minimize the spread in our community and protect our more susceptible residents.”  COVID-19 is spread like the flu. You can help slow the spread of viruses by: Information about COVID-19 is constantly changing, and the public health response adjusts as more is learned about this virus.
