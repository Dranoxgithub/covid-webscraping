Recovery Guidance and Planning



 



With Safer at Home underway and the phased loosening of state restrictions continuing, business and leisure activities are resuming in Denver. Face coverings continue to be mandatory while inside of or waiting in line to enter any retail or commercial business, or any location or facility offering government or health care services and while waiting for or riding on public transportation.
Businesses have been allowed to reopen with 50 percent of employees if they are able to maintain six-foot physical distancing, abide by the face-covering order and other guidelines.
While we are all still safer at home, we are also able to practice greater social distancing in our vast outdoors than in confined indoor spaces. Much of Colorado is now open with restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect those at highest risk for severe illness.

Getting Information on COVID-19
The best source of information for COVID-19 is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. There you’ll find detailed information on topics including:

What You Should Know
How it spreads
Symptoms
Prevention & treatment
Testing
Information for communities, schools, and businesses
Healthcare professionals

Health departments
Travel
Laboratories

For information on COVID-19 from the State, visit the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment; for more localized information, visit Denver Public Health.



Prevention
There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. The CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, such as novel coronavirus:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

The precautions above are even more important when travelling. Be aware of the CDC’s current travel advisories and recommendations by country.



What to Do If You Are Sick
If you are feeling ill and think that you might have COVID-19:

Manage your symptoms at home the same way you manage other cold symptoms. We want to reduce the risk of transmission, so to the extent possible, people with flu-like symptoms should remain at home.
If you need medical care, contact your primary care provider and schedule a visit. Let them know that you are concerned you might have COVID-19.
Only contact 911 for emergencies requiring immediate life-saving care and let them know if you are concerned you might have COVID-19.
Restrict visits to the hospital emergency room or urgent care - only individuals needing immediate care should visit these facilities. If you must visit an ER or urgent care facility, call ahead and let them know that you are concerned you might have COVID-19.
