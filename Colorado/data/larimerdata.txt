Larimer County Public Health, in partnership with local hospitals, has increased COVID-19 testing capacity in the community. 
Testing supplies have become more readily available and local providers have been able to provide testing options for their patients. Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 should call their provider to discuss symptoms and determine whether a COVID-19 test needs to be ordered.  Many providers locally can now order tests for their patients. 
Larimer County Public Health provides no-cost drive-thru testing on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
Anyone, with or without symptoms, is eligible for no cost testing with the health department. People registering for testing must be at least 18 years of age. Walk-ins will be accepted but testing is prioritized for those who pre-register.  To register for COVID-19 testing through Larimer County, please complete the registration form here.
Talk with your health care provider if you’re interested in an antibody test. There are few FDA-authorized antibody tests so few of these tests have had the evaluation and testing to prove that they can provide trustworthy results. Some tests may only detect if you’ve been exposed to the virus, but can't determine if you are immune. Read more about antibody testing for COVID-19 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention here.
The management of COVID-19 has mainly focused on infection prevention, case detection and monitoring, and supportive care. There is no specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) treatment recommended at this time because of the absence of evidence, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
However, people who recover (convalesce) from COVID-19 make antibodies against the virus in the plasma component of their blood. And evidence shows that this convalescent plasma can be used as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 without the occurrence of severe adverse events.
UCHealth has already treated patients using this blood and is looking to identify potential donors of convalescent COVID-19 plasma to be able to treat more COVID-positive patients across the state.
COVID-19 convalescent plasma may only be collected from COVID-19 recovered individuals if they are eligible to donate blood.
You must have:
If you suffered from a respiratory illness over the last eight weeks and believe you may have been exposed to COVID-19, you may be eligible to donate plasma in the near future. Please fill out the forms below. Then, if the opportunity arises for you to donate plasma, coordinators will follow up with you soon. 
In Northern Colorado: Contact UCHealth Garth Englund Blood Center donor recruiter Kaitlin Zobel: 970.495.8987, or fill out this form and someone will contact you. Details on their process and scheduling can be found here.
Please self-isolate at home until at least 10 days after your symptoms start AND 72 hours after your symptoms go away. 
Seek medical care right away if your illness is getting worse (for example, if you have difficulty breathing).
Before going to the doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them your symptoms. Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This is especially important after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
Soap and water: Soap and water are the best option, especially if hands are visibly dirty.
Avoid touching: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available. If you need to be around other people in or outside of the home, wear a facemask.
 Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people in your home.
 After using these items, wash them thoroughly with soap and water or put in the dishwasher.
Clean high-touch surfaces in your isolation area (“sick room” and bathroom) every day; let a caregiver clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in other areas of the home.
High-touch surfaces include phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.
 
Note: If you have an emergency, please call 911. If you need to report a crime or ask a police related question, please call the Larimer County Sheriff's Office at 970-416-1985.
