Posted on: June 8, 2020Due to concerns of COVID-19 and to ensure social distancing at the polls, the Adams County Elections Department has updated the list of Voter Service and Polling Centers (VSPCs) for the State Primary on Tuesday, June 30.The new VSPC locations are in larger buildings, allowing election workers and voters to maintain a six-foot distance and vote safely.Ballot inserts listing VSPC locations were printed prior to this decision and will reflect outdated information. As always, voters can find the most current and trusted information regarding the election at AdamsVotes.com or on the Adams County Clerk & Recorder social media pages: Facebook, Twitter, and NextDoor.“All Adams County voters have the right to vote safely and securely and moving some VSPCs protects that right,” says Adams County Clerk & Recorder Josh Zygielbaum. “My office is reaching out to voters in multiple ways to inform them of the new VSPC locations.”Zygielbaum adds that the safest way to vote during a pandemic is to return a ballot by mail or by dropping it off at a 24-hour drop-box—there are 26 locations across the county. We strongly encourage voters who vote in-person to wear a mask while in the VSPC, but it is not required.Here are the updated VSPC locations for the 2020 State Primary:Adams City Middle School, 4451 E. 72nd Ave., Commerce City 80022Adams County Economic Development, 12200 N.

Posted on: June 5, 2020Last year, the Adams County Children and Family Services (CFS) Division, under the Human Services Department, became the first child welfare agency in Colorado awarded two seals from the Human Rights Campaign. In 2020, the division has repeated its success by again earning both seals – the You Are Welcome Here seal, which certifies the division as an LGBTQ welcoming and affirming agency, and the Recognized Innovator in Supporting and Serving LGBTQ Youth & Families seal.“This recognition affirms our efforts to embody our vision of being the most innovative and inclusive county in America,” said Emma Pinter, Board of County Commissioners Chair. “It’s great to be recognized by the Human Rights Campaign, an outstanding organization with incredible dedication, and it’s also the right thing to do to make sure all our residents know they are supported and valued.”CFS began the process to seek this recognition in 2017, and their efforts have been recognized for the second consecutive year both in Colorado, where Gov. Jared Polis honored the achievement in a public press conference, and nationally by the Human Rights Campaign in their outreach materials. The idea was initiated by CFS staff and fully supported by county leadership.“We are committed to modeling a culture that leads in diversity, equity and inclusivity” said County Manager Raymond Gonzales.To earn these seals, CFS had to demonstrate proficiency in non-discrimination (both client and employment), staff training, rolling out the welcome mat (LGBTQ-inclusive forms and visual cues), parent best practices, youth best practices, and sustainability and capacity building.“The credit for this falls squarely on our hard-working staff in the Children and Family Services division,” said Katie Griego, Human Services Department Director. “They are continually committed to serving their clients, with a special focus on supporting LGBTQ youth, families, and foster families.”The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer civil rights organization, and they envision a world where LGTBQ people are ensured of their basic equal rights and can be open, honest, and safe at home, at work, and in the community.
