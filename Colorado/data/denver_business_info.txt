When is a face covering not required?
A face covering is not required under the following circumstances:

When a person is in a personal office (a single room) where others outside of that person’s household are not present as long as the public does not regularly visit the room. However, that individual must put on a face covering when coworkers are working within six feet, when being visited by a client/customer, and anywhere members of the public or other coworkers are regularly present.
Any child under the age of three should not wear a face covering because of the risk of suffocation.
Childcare facilities should follow CDPHE guidance for the use of face coverings on children age three or older.
When a person is (1) inside or obtaining services at a business, Critical Government Function, or Healthcare Operation, any of which are engaged primarily in providing congregate care, residential health care, or congregate shelter, and (2) the individual is engaged in activities not conducive to wearing a face covering, such as eating or sleeping, or the individual is in an area of the facility that is not designed for community gathering, such as a sleeping area.
When wearing a face covering would inhibit the individual’s health. Workers with health issues that preclude them from wearing a face covering must document those concerns with their employer.

What else can employers and business owners voluntarily do to promote our shared recovery?

Implement symptom monitoring protocols such as temperature checks
Limit or discourage in-person meetings
Discourage use of shared spaces such as breakrooms and meeting rooms
Consider using separate entrances and exits, with staff members counting visitors to control the number of guests at one time
Install plastic protective shields to provide protection between employees and customers 






Enforcing the Public Order





The city will operate on a complaint-based system and on information gathered during site visits
The public should alert the city to non-compliant business practices by calling 311. 





Supporting Small Businesses





In response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mayor Hancock is establishing a Denver Economic Relief and Recovery Council (ERRC). The ERRC will assist in the relief and recovery of Denver's economy by coordinating public and private efforts to assist businesses, nonprofits, employers and workers affected by public health actions taken to prevent community spread of the virus.
The ERRC will serve as an advisory group and will provide strategic recommendations to the Mayor and the city’s executive leadership on how to mitigate and prevent further negative economic impacts of COVID-19, as well as accelerate recovery and future growth for Denver’s economy, businesses and workers. This work will include:

Assessing economic trends and impacts to inform relief and recovery policies and programs;
Providing strategic planning and direction on implementing policy and other recommendations to address COVID-19 related impacts on businesses, workers and nonprofits;
Providing guidance on revisiting current policies that may need to be revised to encourage and incentivize future business growth;
Providing any recommendations realized during committee meetings and endorsed by participants in a consensus manner.






Temporary Outdoor Expansions for Restaurants and Bars





The City and County of Denver is creating a temporary program to allow restaurants and bars to operate in outdoor settings adjacent to their businesses. The intent of the program is to allow for greater physical distancing and safety for patrons when the state’s public health orders allow restaurants and bars to resume sit-down service. While final rules and regulations are still in development, proposals could include expansion into designated outdoor areas such as adjacent parking lots, streets and sidewalks.

With Safer at Home underway and the phased loosening of state restrictions continuing, business and leisure activities are resuming in Denver. As of June 9, face coverings continue to be mandatory while inside of or waiting in line to enter any retail or commercial business, or any location or facility offering government or health care services and while waiting for or riding on public transportation.
Since the beginning of May, many businesses have been allowed to re-open with 50 percent of employees if able to maintain six-foot physical distancing, abide by the face covering order and other guidelines.
As of May 27, the city aligned with the State’s decision allowing restaurants to resume limited sit-down service. Face coverings are required for restaurant employees and customers, except while eating and drinking.
Everyone is urged to continue to stay at home unless absolutely necessary. We know this is a big ask of our residents and businesses, but it is a necessary step to ensure the health and safety of our community.
