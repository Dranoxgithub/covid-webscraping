Tips for social distancing












All residents are urged to 
practice social distancing
:


Stay approximately six feet away from other people.


Wear a face covering or mask
 in public.


Avoid large crowds and gatherings. 


Practice good hygiene: continue to wash hands, use hand sanitizer, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your inner elbow, and stay home if you are sick.


Certain people are at higher risk
 for serious illness from this virus. High-risk individuals include:


older adults, and


people with an underlying health condition, including (but not limited to) heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, obesity.








Individuals at higher risk should
:


stay home and avoid situations of potential exposure


do not travel


do not attend large gatherings


limit time spent in public areas, and


do not congregate in groups of more than 10 people.


Residents should limit interactions with persons who are at higher risk for COVID-19.
 If you live with someone at high risk, practice social distancing. We all have personal responsibility to take care of ourselves and others, to protect ourselves and our loved ones.













Do not mix cleaning products












It's dangerous to mix these cleaning products together:


Bleach and vinegar


Bleach and ammonia


Bleach and rubbing alcohol


Hydrogen peroxide and vinegar








Mixing 
bleach and vinegar
 together makes chlorine gas which can cause:


coughing


breathing problems, and


burning and watery eyes.


Mixing 
bleach and ammonia
 together makes a toxic gas named chloramine which can cause:


shortness of breath, and


chest pain.


Mixing 
bleach and rubbing alcohol
 together makes chloroform, which is very toxic.


Mixing 
hydrogen peroxide and vinegar
 together makes peracetic / peroxyacetic acid which is very corrosive.













Coping with stress












The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children.


Taking care of yourself, your friends, and your family can help you cope with stress. Helping others cope with their stress can also make your community stronger.


Stress during an infectious disease outbreak can include:


fear and worry about your own health and the health of your loved ones


changes in sleep or eating patterns


difficulty sleeping or concentrating


worsening of chronic health problems, and


increased use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs


People with preexisting mental health conditions should continue with their treatment and be aware of new or worsening symptoms. Additional information can be found at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website.






Things you can do to support yourself


Stay up to date about developments related to COVID-19 by using reliable and accurate sources of health-related information, such as the CDC and BPHC.


Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic constantly can be upsetting.


Take care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, and get plenty of sleep.


Focus on positive aspects of your life and things that you can control.


Make time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy.


Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling.


Reduce stress in yourself and others


Sharing the facts about COVID-19 and understanding the actual risk to yourself and people you care about can make an outbreak less stressful. When you share accurate information about COVID-19 you can help make people feel less stressed and allow you to connect with them.


If you, or someone you care about, are feeling overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, depression, or anxiety, or feel like you want to harm yourself or others call:


911


Call or text Samaritans Inc. 24/7 at 
877-870-4673
 (HOPE)


Call your healthcare provider if stress gets in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row.

Centers for Disease Control's website

People still need to continue to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene, even when wearing a face covering. Wearing a face covering may help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Boston residents are also urged to stay home as much as possible, especially if sick.

Face covering basics





 What is a face covering?
A face covering is any well-secured paper or cloth (like a bandana or scarf) that covers the mouth and nose. The face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are crucial supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders.
Who should wear a face covering?
Anyone who needs to be outside of their home is encouraged to wear a face covering and practice social distancing.
People who are sick should not leave their home and should also wear a face covering while inside if they cannot stay 6 feet apart from others. People who are sick and need to leave home, such as to get urgent medical care, should always wear a face covering.
Per the CDC, face coverings should not be placed on young children under 2-years-old, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.


How do I wear a face covering?
Face coverings should:
fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face
be secured with ties or ear loops
include multiple layers of fabric, if it is a cloth covering, and
allow for breathing without restriction.
Is it possible to make your own face covering?
Yes. A face covering can be a scarf, bandana or other cloth. For directions on how to make a cloth face covering at home, visit the Centers for Disease Control website. You can also watch the video tutorials section below.

Face covering tips





Do face coverings need to be worn all the time when outside of the house?
Anyone who needs to be outside of their home is encouraged to wear a face covering and practice social distancing.
If a person is sick, yes, a face covering should be worn at all times when outside. People who have COVID-19 must stay home and only leave for essential medical care or to get basic necessities such as groceries.
Should a face covering be worn while exercising?
BPHC is encouraging everyone to wear a face covering when outside. When exercising, if people need to remove a face covering to breathe adequately, make sure no one is around before removing it. Keep the face covering readily available so it can be placed back on  should a person come within 6 feet of others. It is also important for people to stay at least 6 feet away from one another. People should only do exercise that enables them to keep physical distance from others. Walking, running, and biking are good examples of activities that do not require shared equipment or close contact with others.
Should people who had COVID-19 and are now better wear a face covering?
There is a lot we still don’t know about COVID-19, including how long the virus remains in someone’s body and whether it’s possible to get sick again. For this reason, it is recommended that people continue physical distancing and other precautions even after they recover from COVID-19. This includes wearing a face covering when they are outside their home.
Why is this recommendation been made now?
There is a lot we are still learning about COVID-19. However, there is increased evidence that people without symptoms may be able to spread the virus, and that droplets produced when breathing, speaking, or singing may spread COVID-19 from person to person. The use of a face covering will help stop the spread of COVID-19. Staying home and practicing physical distancing and good hand hygiene are still the most important ways to stop the spread of COVID-19.
How often should cloth face coverings be washed?
It is recommended to wash once a day by hand or machine using detergent. The face covering should be fully dry before using. People should have a couple of face coverings so they can rotate for washing.


What type of face covering is better, paper or cloth?
Either paper or cloth face covering is fine as long as it covers the nose and mouth. The face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are crucial supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders to care for the most critically ill. Health care workers and first responders cannot keep distance from others, avoid sick people, or avoid contact with others’ bodily fluid, such as respiratory secretion and saliva, so it is essential that we reserve masks for them.
How long can paper face coverings be used?
Non-health care worker paper face coverings should be used once. A new one should be used every day. Health care worker masks, such as N95 or surgical masks, should not be used in order to preserve protective equipment for health care workers and those serving on the front lines in response to COVID-19.
Are there any precautions that need to be taken when removing face coverings?
Wash hands for 20 seconds with soap and water every time you take on and off the face covering. If soap and water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Individuals should be careful not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth when removing face covering.
Do not put a used face covering in places where others can touch them or where germs trapped in your face covering can touch other surfaces, such as counter tops or a kitchen table.
Used paper masks should be thrown out at the end of the day in the regular trash so others will not come in contact with them.
Do not throw your face covering loose in a bag or backpack. Keep a paper or plastic bag with you to store your face covering if you will be taking if off when outside the house.
can i donate a face covering?
You can donate various types of face coverings to first responders and public health parters through our online donation form.
You can also request masks for your organization or volunteer to create masks through the Boston Area Mask Initiative.

              Last updated:             5/5/20



When you should be tested for COVID-19
We have answers to common questions below about when you should be tested for the coronavirus (COVID-19).





Could I have COVID-19?
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. The most common method to acquire COVID-19 is through direct contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19. However, community transmission is happening in some areas. Community transmission occurs when a virus spreads and the source is not known.
Should I go to my doctor and get tested for COVID-19? 
If you have symptoms of this virus, you should call your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will assess your symptoms and will determine if you should be tested.  It is important that everyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 seek care to confirm diagnosis.  This will allow you to receive appropriate advice on caring for yourself and preventing spread to your family, friends, and other close contacts.  This is especially important for individuals at high risk for complications from COVID-19, such as:
older adults, age 60 years or over
people with underlying health conditions
people with weakened immune systems, and
pregnant women.
If you are a healthcare worker in contact with patients or other healthcare workers, or if you are a first responder (EMS, fire, police), you need to be tested regardless of the high-risk criteria if you become symptomatic.
Are there free testing sites in the City of Boston?
The City of Boston is partnering with community health centers to increase access to testing, particularly in neighborhoods experiencing higher rates of COVID-19. View our map of testing sites for more details. Please note:
Testing is free regardless of insurance or immigration status, and will not affect "public charge" rule determinations.  
All sites require you to call ahead for pre-screening and to schedule an appointment.
If I think I may have COVID-19 or another respiratory infection, what should I do to keep my infection from spreading to my family and other people in the community?
Stay home except to get medical care.
Do not go to work, school, or public areas.
Do not use public transportation, ridesharing, or taxis.
Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home.
As much as possible, you should stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available. If you must share a bathroom, you or your housemates should clean surfaces regularly (see below).
Wear a surgical type mask or cover your nose and mouth with a scarf or other cloth if you are in the same room with others.
Call ahead before visiting your doctor
If you need to have a medical visit, call the health care provider and tell them that you have symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19. This will help the health care provider’s office take steps to keep other people from getting exposed or infected.
Wear a facemask or face covering
Wear a facemask when you are around other people (for example, sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office.
If you do not have a face mask, cover your nose and mouth with a scarf or other home-made face covering (such as a cut-up tee shirt or similar). 
If you are not able to wear a face covering (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then people who live with you should not be in the same room with you, or they should wear a face covering if they enter your room.
Cover your coughs and sneezes
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw used tissues in a lined trash can. If you do not have a tissue, cover your cough or sneeze with your arm and elbow, not your hand.
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if water and soap are not available.
Avoid sharing personal household items
Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home.
After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. 
Clean your hands often
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching surfaces and objects that others touch frequently (“high-touch” surfaces) with unwashed hands.
Clean all 'high-touch' surfaces every day
High-touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.
Clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions.
Monitor your symptoms
Seek medical attention right away if your illness is gets worse (e.g., difficulty breathing).
Before seeking care, call your health care provider and tell them that your symptoms are consistent with COVID-19.
Put on a facemask before you enter the facility.
If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19. If possible, put on a facemask before emergency medical services arrive.
When can I end home isolation?
If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you should remain under home isolation precautions until it is determined that you are no longer contagious. Your local public health department will communicate this with you. If you were unable to get tested but were told to isolate by a medical provider, please reach out to your primary care provider for guidance on release from isolation.
If you do not have a primary care provider, call the Mayor’s Health Line at 617-534-5050.

Boston Public Schools are closed through the 2019-20 school year due to the coronavirus pandemic. MCAS tests have also been canceled this spring. 
We are prepared to meet the unique needs of our students to continue their learning and provide support to our families. Information about grading, attendance, schedules, and can be found in the letter below:

Boston Public Schools Remote Learning Plan

View/Download all FAQs
 
What is COVID-19?
Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 (formerly referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) is a new respiratory virus that was first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. 
How does COVID-19 spread? 
COVID-19 is caused by a respiratory virus.  It can spread from an infected person to another person through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes on someone who is within 6 feet. It is like how influenza or other respiratory germs spread. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.  Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials, but once dried on the surface it is not likely to cause infection.  Routine cleaning and sanitizing are sufficient to remove any remaining risk for transmission from wet or dry surfaces. 
 
What are the symptoms and possible complications?
People with COVID-19 have reported mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Additional symptoms such as chills, and loss sense of taste and smell have also been reported. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia. 
How can I help protect myself? 
There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid exposure to the virus. BPHC always recommends standard precautions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:
Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Using alcohol-based hand rubs and gels.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick
Staying home when you are sick.
Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue or cough into your sleeve.
Washing or sanitizing your hands before touching your face.
Not sharing drinks, food, or eating utensils.
Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Does wearing a mask prevent the spread of COVID-19?   
A facemask or face covering should be worn by anyone above the age of 2 when they are outside their home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is especially important for people with suspected or confirmed respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses to wear a face covering because it will help protect others from getting infected. A facemask should also be worn by health care workers and people who are taking care of someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.   
Do I need to be tested for COVID-19?  
If you have symptoms of this virus, you should call your health care provider. Your health care provider will assess your symptoms and possibility of exposure and will determine if you should be tested. 
It is especially important to be tested if are an individual at high risk such as: 
Older adults, age 60 years or over  
People with underlying health conditions  
People with weakened immune systems  
If you are a health care worker in contact with patients or other health care workers, or if you are a first responder (EMS, fire, police), you need to be tested regardless of the high-risk criteria if you become symptomatic. There are currently no medications to treat COVID19.
