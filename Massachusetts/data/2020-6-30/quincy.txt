Mayor Koch announced that the City's 30 tot-lot playgrounds will be opened effective immediately in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for Phase 2 of the Covid-19 re-opening plan. Recreation staff will clean the playgrounds three times per day, seven days per week. The playgrounds will have to be closed for 15-minute breaks during and immediately after each cleaning. Playground capacity will be limited to 10 children at a time to help adhere to social distancing guidelines. Adults are asked to wear masks while attending to children at the parks. If playgrounds are at capacity, a one-hour time limit will be enforced to ensure equitable use. Hand-washing stations have been placed at most park locations and park-goers are encouraged to thoroughly wash their hands before and after using the parks and playgrounds.   Basketball and tennis courts will remain open and monitored by Recreation staff to ensure residents adhere to the updated restrictions.
