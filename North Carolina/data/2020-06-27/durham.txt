FAQs for Durham’s June 1 AmendmentCan personal care, grooming, and tattoo businesses open?Businesses in this category may open and commence operations on Monday, June 1, 2020, at 8:00 a.m. These businesses must comply with social distancing and sanitation requirements in Section 2.C the requirements of Executive Order 141.What does it mean for businesses to “self-certify"? Self-certifying means businesses are voluntarily agreeing to follow a set of best practices based on guidance by public health experts for reducing the spread of COVID-19. Businesses will have the opportunity to demonstrate they have self-certified by publicly and prominently displaying at their place of business a checklist of safety guidelines that the task force will develop in collaboration with local experts. The checklist will include both a common set of best practices we expect of all gathering places as well as optional industry-specific practices.How will the self-certification process work? Is there a form or statement that businesses much use or post?In the coming week, the task force will release additional information about the process. The important thing to know now is that the process is voluntary and will not delay businesses from opening who are able to open under local orders. The goal of the task force is to release the process before June 1st. The process will entail downloading and printing a self-certification checklist for your industry and posting it prominently in a place in your businesses where all customers will see it upon entering.  The checklist will serve as a reminder to our businesses of the practices they are committing to follow.  Prominently displaying it will encourage accountability to business patrons who will know what they should expect upon entering the establishment.  Although the self-certification process is based on trust that businesses will comply, is there enforcement and to whom should noncompliance be reported?This self-certification process is entirely voluntary. It is not required, so there will be no enforcement of it. Rather, the self-certification process is a way for businesses to give confidence to their customers, clients and employees that they are providing a safe place to work, shop and receive services.

COVID-19 Safer-At-Home Order Questions
View the  Safer-At-Home Order here.




What's in the latest Order?
Click here to see what's allowed and what's closed, and learn how the local order compares to the state.

Why is the Durham Order different from the state's?
Although Durham has done well in flattening the curve of cases of the virus and slowing its spread, we have recently had a significant increase in cases. We have recently had growth in our cases at twice the level of the state of North Carolina as a whole. In addition, our cases per capita are three times the per capita rate in Wake County. With these concerning trends, the city and county are being a bit more cautious than the state in our Safer-At-Home order. 


What does it mean for businesses to “self-certify? 
Self-certifying means businesses are voluntarily agreeing to follow a set of best practices based on guidance by public health experts for reducing the spread of COVID-19. Businesses will have the opportunity to demonstrate they have self-certified by publicly and prominently displaying at their place of business a checklist of safety guidelines that the task force will develop in collaboration with local experts. The checklist will include both a common set of best practices we expect of all gathering places as well as optional industry-specific practices.


How will the self-certification process work? Is there a form or statement that businesses much use or post?
The task force will soon release additional information about the process. The important thing to know now is that the process is voluntary and will not delay businesses from opening who are able to open under local orders.  The process will entail downloading and printing a self-certification checklist for your industry and posting it prominently in a place in your businesses where all customers will see it upon entering.  The checklist will serve as a reminder to our businesses of the practices they are committing to follow.  Prominently displaying it will encourage accountability to business patrons who will know what they should expect upon entering the establishment. 


Although the self-certification process is based on trust that businesses will comply, is there enforcement and to whom should noncompliance be reported?






This self-certification process is entirely voluntary. It is not required, so there will be no enforcement of it. Rather, the self-certification process is a way for businesses to give confidence to their customers, clients and employees that they are providing a safe place to work, shop and receive services.

Report COVID-19 cases to the Durham County Department of Public Health by faxing the COVID-19 Reporting Form   to 919-560-7716. 

Where can I find COVID case data?

Should I wear a mask?
Beginning April 20, 2020, all Durham County residents are required  to wear a clean face covering any time they are or will be in contact with other people who are not household members in public or private spaces where it is not possible to maintain social distance such as grocery stories, pharmacies, business location and public transit.  This is to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms. 
Surgical masks and N95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers or other medical first responders, as recommended by CDC guidance.'
For more information on how to make and wear cloth masks, click here.

Should I get tested?
NCDHHS guidance recommends the following people should consider getting teseted for COVID-19: 

Anyone with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.
Close contacts of known positive cases, regardless of symptoms.
The following groups are some of the populations with higher risk of exposure or a higher risk of severe disease if they become infected. People in these groups should get tested if they believe they may have been exposed to COVID-19, whether or not they have symptoms.  
    
People who live in or have regular contact with high-risk settings (e.g., long-term care facility, homeless shelter, correctional facility, migrant farmworker camp).
Historically marginalized populations who may be at higher risk for exposure.
Frontline and essential workers (grocery store clerks, gas station attendants, child care workers, construction sites, processing plants, etc.) in settings where social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Health care workers or first responders (e.g. EMS, law enforcement, fire department, military).
People who are at high risk of severe illness (e.g., people over 65 years of age, people of any age with underlying health conditions).


People who have attended protests, rallies, or other mass gatherings could have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or could have exposed others. Testing should be considered for people who attended such events, particularly if they were in crowds or other situations where they couldn’t practice effective social distancing.


What are symptoms of COVID-19?
 

People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the viru

Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Chills
Repeated shaking with chills
Muscle pain
Headache
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell

 


When to seek medical attention
 
If you have any of these emergency warning signs* for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:

Trouble breathing
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion or inability to arouse
Bluish lips or face

*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19. If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.
 

 

Where can I get tested?
Visit our data hub for help locating a testing facility near you! https://durhampublichealth-durhamnc.hub.arcgis.com/

Are certain groups at higher risk of serious illness?
All people are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and suffering serious illness. Certain groups are at higher risk of suffering serious illness from COVID-19: 



People aged 65 years and older


People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility
Other high-risk conditions could include:
        
People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People who have heart disease with complications
People who are immunocompromised including cancer treatment
People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [(BM]I)≥40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease might also be at risk



There is limited information so far about COVID-19 in pregnant women. Pregnant women are at higher risk from influenza and other respiratory viruses, so they are encouraged to be extra vigilant.



How can I protect myself from COVID-19?
There are some common sense measures everyone can take to protect themselves and others from the spread of respiratory illnesses including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each time.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands
Avoid close contact with people who are ill.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
Do not reuse tissue after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. 
Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched.
Practice social distancing.
Wear cloth face coverings to prevent spreading germs to others.


How many people have been tested in NC?
The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NC DHHS) provides NC testing totals, as well as totals of confirmed positive tests and COVID-19 deaths here. 

How will I know if someone near me has tested positive for COVID-19?
When an individual tests positive for COVID-19, DCoDPH works to conduct a contact investigation, determining if an individual was in close contact with others while symptomatic. When DCoDPH conducts conduct contact investigations, we work to contact individuals who have been in close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases.
