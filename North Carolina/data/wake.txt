Guidance for Residents




Beginning May 22, North Carolina entered the second phase of easing certain restrictions under Gov. Roy Cooper’s reopening plans.
The “Safer-at-Home” phase enables people can gather in small groups of more than 10 people. Restaurants and places of worship can operate at a limited capacity. Public playgrounds remain closed.
On June 24, Gov. Cooper extended the Safer at Home phase until at least July 17. He also issued a statewide face mask order to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. This order states that people must wear face coverings when in public places where physical distancing is not possible.  In addition, certain businesses must have employees and customers wear face coverings.
For more info on North Carolina’s COVID-19 response, call the NC 2-1-1 hotline or consult the state’s COVID-19 guidance resources.
Wear. Wait. Wash.
If you do leave home, practice your W’s: Wear, Wait, Wash

Wear a cloth face covering if you will be with other people.
Wait 6 feet apart. Avoid close contact.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer.

These actions can protect our families and neighbors as the state takes a cautious step forward while the virus is still circulating.
What To Do If You Feel Sick

If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 contact your health care provider or telehealth program to discuss whether you should be evaluated for testing.
Community partners are providing testing sites throughout Wake County for any experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.
If you fall within one of our specific targeted groups, you may be a good candidate for our free drive-thru testing.
If you have trouble breathing, call 9-1-1.

Who Should be Tested for COVID-19
North Carolina is focused on rapidly increasing testing of people who may not currently have symptoms but may have been exposed to COVID-19. NCDHHS released updated guidance for doctors and clinicians on who should be tested for COVID-19.
This includes:

Anyone with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.
Close contacts of known positive cases, regardless of symptoms.
Groups of some of the populations with higher risk of exposure or a higher risk of severe disease if they become infected. People in these groups should get tested if they believe they may have been exposed to COVID-19, whether or not they have symptoms.
People who live in or have regular contact with high-risk settings (e.g., long-term care facility, homeless shelter, correctional facility, migrant farmworker camp).
People from historically marginalized populations who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. This fact sheet provides best practices for community testing in historically marginalized populations.
Frontline and essential workers (grocery store clerks, gas station attendants, child care workers, construction sites, processing plants, etc.)
Health care workers or first responders.
People who are at higher risk of severe illness.
People who have attended protests, rallies, or other mass gatherings could have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or could have exposed others.

Information on Wake County’s testing opportunities can be found here.

Guidance for Businesses




Beginning May 22, North Carolina entered the second phase of easing certain restrictions under Gov. Roy Cooper’s reopening plans. In phase two, businesses can be open but with restrictions and smaller capacities. Bars, gyms, nightclubs, movie theaters, museums, bowling alleys, amusement parks, arcades and skating rinks will remain closed. Teleworking is still strongly encouraged where possible.
On June 24, Gov. Cooper extended his Safer at Home phase 2 reopening, and issued a statewide face mask order to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. This order states that people must wear face coverings when in public places where physical distancing is not possible.  In addition, certain businesses must have employees and customers wear face coverings.








 What businesses will remain closed during Phase 2? Bars, nightclubs, spas, exercise facilities, gyms, fitness studios, martial arts facilities, dance studios, trampoline and rock-climbing facilities, roller skating rinks, ice staking rinks and basketball courts must remain closed.
 How can I protect customers at my restaurant, hotel or other business that serves the public? As restaurants, hotels, attractions and other businesses that serve the public reopen in phases, Count On Me NC has training to help companies keep patrons safe from COVID-19. Training is available for owners, front- and back-of-house restaurant staff, sanitation workers and more. Businesses that complete training are provided Count On Me NC branding materials to show customers they have taken the pledge to protect against COVID-19.
Count On Me NC is partnership among the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, N.C. Restaurant and Lodging Association, N.C. State Cooperative Extension and Visit NC.
 How do I protect workers at my business? If your business is open, workers and clients are advised to practice social distancing. That includes:

Staying at least six feet away from others;
Wearing a cloth face covering in public settings;
Washing hands frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds;
Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that get touched often;
Covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze;
Regularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that get touched often; and
Not shaking hands.

Additionally, employers should:

Order employees to stay home when they are sick.
Be flexible in sick leave benefits.
Consider staggering start and end times of employees, to reduce large numbers of people coming together at the same time.
Offer opportunities for teleworking.

Additional information can be found on the NCDHHS site here.
 I run a childcare facility. How should I protect our children and staff? To the extent possible, childcare facilities must also follow the state’s guidance for their facilities.
 Where can I go for help during this economically challenging time for my business? Wake County is partnering with the Raleigh Chamber of Commerce and Wake County Economic Development to share resources with all businesses impacted by closures and service restrictions. You can visit their COVID-19 resource page for more information.
 If I have to lay off employees, what can I do? Capital Area Workforce Development can support businesses and impacted workers facing layoffs, closures and other sensitive business actions.  These rapid response services are customized and offered virtually. Contact Kimberly Wheeler at 919-856-6046 or kimberly.wheeler@wakegov.com.
People can apply for unemployment on the N.C. Department of Commerce’s website. Under Gov. Roy Cooper’s executive order signed on March 17, unemployment benefits will be easier to access during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 What are the special restrictions for nursing homes? Nursing homes, long-term care facilities and assisted living centers are no longer allowed to receive visitors, per Gov. Roy Cooper’s executive order. These facilities must also cease all group activities that don’t allow for social distancing.
 Are restaurants in Wake County closed? Starting on Friday, May 22, Wake County restaurants can reopen dining rooms but at limited capacity.
 Are face coverings required in my business? People are required to wear Face Coverings in the following settings, whether they are inside or outside:

Retail businesses
Restaurants (including customers when not seated at their tables)
Personal care, grooming and tattoo businesses
Childcare facilities, day camps and overnight camps
State government agencies
Transportation services
Meat or poultry processing plants
Long term care facilities
Health care services
Any other facility where social distancing is difficult

 What are the exceptions to wearing a face mask at my business? The governor’s order does not require face coverings for workers, customers or patrons who:

Can’t wear a face covering due to medical or behavioral conditions or disabilities. This includes, but not limited to, trouble breathing, unconscious or incapacitated, or is otherwise unable to put on or remove the face covering without assistance;
Are under 11 years of age;
Are actively eating or drinking;

On May 8, the Governor’s phased approach to easing restrictions of travel, business operations and gatherings went into effect with Phase 1.
On May 22, the Governor’s approach to easing restrictions lifted the stay-at-home order and enter Phase 2 of reopening.
Under the current order:

Restaurants can reopen dining rooms at 50% capacity. All staff must wear face coverings and practice strict cleaning procedures.
Personal care businesses, including barber shops, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlors, tanning salons and massage therapists, must also operate at 50 percent capacity. These businesses must be by appointment only.
Bars, nightclubs, gyms and health clubs must remain closed.
Pools may reopen at 50 percent capacity.

 Other COVID-19-Related FAQs


 How is the virus spread? 

According to the CDC:


“The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person:



Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.
Maintaining good social distance (about 6 feet) is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.”



 Can the COVID-19 virus live on surfaces? According to the CDC, it may be possible for a person to "get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes."
 Who is most at risk for contracting COVID-19 in Wake County? While anyone can contract COVID-19, adults older than 65, people with underlying health conditions and pregnant women should take extra precautions as they may be at higher risk for developing serious illness associated with the disease.
 I’m worried about getting COVID-19. What can I do to keep myself and my family safe? 

Some ways to lessen your risk for getting COVID-19 include:




Staying home and using teleworking technology when possible.
Washing your hands.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Practicing social distancing and staying away from sick people.
Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces using regular household cleaning spray or wipes.





Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash.
Staying home if you’re sick and avoiding close contact with others for three days after symptoms resolve.



 What is social distancing? Social distancing is a public health strategy that prevents close contact between people with the aim to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. Tactics that people can use to support social distancing include maintaining six feet of space between each other when in public and avoiding events with large numbers of people. The goal is to slow the spread of COVID-19 so that spread is contained as much as possible and there’s less strain on our healthcare system to care for sick people. The goal is to slow the spread of COVID-19, so fewer people get sick and there’s less strain on our healthcare system. For more information, visit here.
 I have spent time with someone who has COVID-19. What should I do? If you have been in close contact with a known positive case of COVID-19, you are a good candidate for our free drive-thru testing.
You should stay home for 14 days, as much as possible, and monitor yourself for symptoms. If you develop symptoms, self-isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms and at least three days after symptoms resolve.
 Do I need to wear a mask to protect myself while in public? Facemasks should be used to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).
CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
The state of North Carolina requires face masks in public anytime you are not in a position to stay at least six feet apart.
 I’m sick with a fever, cough and shortness of breath. What should I do? If you believe you have symptoms of COVID-19, you can be tested at one of the testing locations throughout Wake County.
If serious illness develops, call your primary care provider. If you have trouble breathing, call 9-1-1.
 Are pets at risk of COVID-19? The Wake County Animal Center is monitoring how COVID-19 may affect pets, following reports of pets in the U.S. having tested positive for the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Routine testing of domestic animals for COVID-19 is not currently recommended.
Until we know more, the CDC recommends pet owners take the following precautions:

Do not let pets interact with people or other animals outside the household.
Keep cats indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet from other people and animals.
Avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.

If you have symptoms or a confirmed case of COVID-19, restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would around other people.

When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.
Avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.
Follow general guidelines for staying healthy around animals.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. In rare cases, a strain that infects animals can spread to people. The CDC does not know its exact source, but the coronavirus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19 is suspected to have originated in animals and spread to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the new coronavirus, according to the CDC. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
 My relative lives in a nursing home. I’d like to visit her, but is that safe? Visitors are not currently permitted to visit nursing homes, long-term care facilities and assisted living centers as ordered by Gov. Roy Cooper.
 I’m a caregiver for a senior citizen. Should I do anything different than usual? The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services has posted a guide for individuals and families to avoid spreading COVID-19 within the home. Just like the general public, caretakers and those who share a home with someone in the increased risk group should take steps to limit their exposure to all kinds of contagious diseases, including COVID-19. If people think they’ve contracted COVID-19, they should take steps to avoid spreading the virus to anyone else, including those in their home or care who are in the higher-risk group. The CDC has additional resources for families to avoid spreading the disease among themselves.
 I am concerned that I may have COVID-19. How can I get tested? Now that community spread has been confirmed in North Carolina, testing by Wake County is focused on those most at risk of developing serious illness, including those over the age of 65, people with underlying health conditions and pregnant women.
If you have symptoms, self-isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms. If you develop serious illness, call your primary care doctor for evaluation. If you experience difficulty breathing, call 9-1-1.
 What is community spread? Community spread means that there are COVID-19-positive people who do not know how or where they became infected with the virus.
 Why are healthcare workers focusing on testing at-risk populations? Now that North Carolina has community transmission of the virus, we have moved to a community-based mitigation strategy, aimed at decreasing the spread, especially among those most at risk of serious illness. In this phase, testing and contact tracing are more focused than in the broad-based containment approach we executed early in the outbreak. 
This change in strategy allows us to be more vigilant about conserving resources like personal protective equipment for our healthcare workers and directing testing to those more likely to become seriously ill.
 Which Wake County phone number should I call to ask questions about COVID-19 or share my concerns? We have set up a few different phone numbers depending on your question. Visit our "Contact" page to get the email address of phone number best-suited for your need.
 I’m concerned about kids who don’t have access to nutritional meals now that school is closed. How can I help? The Wake County Public School System, Wake County and its partners are working together to make sure that food is available to hungry students during these unprecedented times. If you would like to volunteer to support food distribution sites, please complete the Food Security and Access Volunteer Form.
Please direct all food donations to the Interfaith Food Shuttle or Food Bank of Central and Eastern NC.
 What is the COVID-19 antibody test? Antibody tests measure proteins called immunoglobulins, that the body produces to help fight off infections. It takes time for our immune systems to make antibodies, which is why the test is done after symptoms go away. The test helps determine if someone had an immune response to COVID-19 but does not tell us if the person has COVID-19 currently.
There is still a lot we don’t know about SarsCoV-2 or COVID-19, including interpretation of Antibody tests. According to the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), there are at least 90 tests on the market, and we don’t yet know which ones are best.
 If I test positive for the antibody, does that mean I had—or have—the virus? We aren’t sure. Right now, we don’t know enough about the test to determine its accuracy. It’s unknown whether the test can tell the difference between past infections from SARS-CoV-2 and the six other coronaviruses, four of which cause the common cold. It’s important to note that the antibody test is not a replacement for the diagnostic test.
If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, you should:

Stay away from other people for 10 days after your symptoms begin
When you no longer have symptoms, you should stay home without fever for three more days
If you feel you need medical care, call your doctor. If you have trouble breathing, call 9-1-1.

 If I test positive for the antibody, does that mean I am immune to COVID-19? No. According to the World Health Organization, there is currently not enough evidence to tell us that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection. At this point, until testing improves, and we understand more about the virus, everyone is still considered at risk.
 What can the results be used for? This test is done after recovery from COVID-19, to detect an immune response from exposure. However, until the accuracy of the tests can be determined, there’s not much health officials can do with results. At this point, residents and/or providers do not need to report their results to the Wake County Division of Public Health or the North Carolina Division of Health and Human Services.
Cautions about the use of antibody results

The presence of COVID-19 antibodies cannot currently be used to diagnose someone as having COVID-19.
Positive antibody results cannot tell us with certainty that someone is “immune” to future infection. If protection does exist, we don’t know for how long.
Positive results cannot certify people as safe to work or travel if they’ve already been sick.
Positive results cannot tell us with certainty that the antibody detected is specifically due to COVID-19, and not another coronavirus (e.g. common cold).
Negative results do not rule out the possibility of COVID-19 infection. If you have symptoms of infection, ask your doctor about testing for presence of the virus itself.

Guidance for Healthcare Providers




Information about COVID-19 is changing rapidly. To keep our healthcare partners updated on the latest information and guidance, Wake County Public Health has compiled some of the questions we are being asked frequently. We hope that these Q&A’s will help providers get the information they need about this evolving situation while also providing a better understanding of public health’s role, as we partner with healthcare providers to manage this novel coronavirus.




 What are symptoms of COVID-19? People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:

Fever or chills
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Muscle or body aches
Headache
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea

 Who is at risk for contracting COVID-19? Given that there is community spread of the virus in our state, anyone can contract the virus from their daily interactions with other people. At this point in the pandemic, people with the virus may not know where they became infected or who transmitted the virus to them.
 What should I do with a patient who is exhibiting the symptoms associated with COVID-19? Please follow the excellent guidance provided by NCDHHS. In general, healthcare providers should screen patients before they enter the facility, either via telephone or telehealth/video triage. Telehealth or telephone triage allows clinicians to evaluate patients with mild symptoms and provide guidance on home care and follow-up, while preventing further spread of COVID-19.
If the patient is experiencing fever (subjective or measured), respiratory or GI  symptoms, they should be advised to isolate at home for at least 10 days since symptoms first appeared AND at least 72 hours since resolution of fever (without the use of fever reducing medications) AND improvement in respiratory symptoms. They should also be advised to contact their provider if their symptoms are not getting better.
If, however, their symptoms become more serious (difficulty breathing, altered mental status), patients should be advised to call before seeking in-person care or call 9-1-1, and disclose their symptoms so emergency medical providers can take appropriate steps in transporting the patient to a facility where they can be treated.
Patients who enter a healthcare facility exhibiting fever or flu-like symptoms should be masked immediately and providers should ensure proper use of personal protective equipment. The patient should be separated from other patients, ideally in a well-ventilated space.
 Who should be tested for COVID-19? Current NCDHHS Guidance suggests that clinicians should conduct or arrange for diagnostic COVID-19 testing for:

Anyone with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19
Close contacts of known positive cases, regardless of symptoms
The following groups are some of the populations with higher risk of exposure or a higher risk of severe disease if they become infected. People in these groups should get tested if they believe they may have been exposed to COVID-19, whether or not they have symptoms.

People who live in or have regular contact with high-risk settings (e.g., long-term care facility, homeless shelter, correctional facility, migrant farmworker camp)
Historically Marginalized populations who may be at higher risk for exposure
Frontline and essential workers (grocery store clerks, gas station attendants, childcare workers, construction sites, processing plants, etc.) in settings where social distancing is difficult to maintain
Health care workers or first responders (e.g. EMS, law enforcement, fire department, military)
People who are at high risk of severe illness (e.g., people over 65 years of age, people of any age with underlying health conditions)


People who have attended protests, rallies, or other mass gatherings could have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or could have exposed others. Testing should be considered for people who attended such events, particularly if they were in crowds or other situations where they couldn’t practice effective social distancing.

Physicians should consider testing for flu prior to testing for COVID-19.
Each time a provider tests a patient for COVID-19, the practice must:

Fill out a PUI form and fax it to the Wake County Public Health Division (919-212-9291) and the state (919-733-0490).
If patient was tested but has not symptoms and no known exposure to someone with COVID-19 (for example, as a part of a workplace screening program, they do not need to stay home while waiting results unless told to do so by an employer or by public health.

 What if one of my patients tests positive for COVID-19? If the result of the test is positive, healthcare providers must notify the patient and advise that they be isolated at home. In addition, other people in the patient’s home should remain quarantined at home, away from the patient, and self-monitor for fever and symptoms for 14 days.
Results may be faxed to Wake County Public Health at 919-743-7362.
The patient should also be advised that if they begin to experience severe symptoms to call their healthcare provider before going to the provider’s office. In the case of a medical emergency, patients should call 9-1-1 and disclose that they have been diagnosed with COVID-19 so that emergency providers can be sure to respond appropriately.
Once a test is confirmed positive, Wake County Public Health will contact the patient. This includes reaching out to the healthcare provider to determine whether any practice staff had a significant exposure.
Please note that false negative results are possible. If COVID-19 testing is negative, consider if patient’s recent exposure and clinical presentation are consistent with COVID-19. Retesting should be considered in consultation with local public health.
 How can our office test for COVID-19? Testing to detect COVID-19 is available through commercial labs and the NC State Laboratory of Public Health (NCSLPH). Testing at the NCSLPH is only available with prior approval by the local health department or the state epidemiologist on call.
LabCorp tests do NOT require confirmation testing from the CDC.
 How is the specimen is collected? COVID-19 testing requires specimens collected from the nose, throat or lungs. These specimens must be collected by a healthcare provider. Details on how to collect specimens can be found on LabCorp’s site.
View more questions and answers about LabCorps’s test and how it is administered.
 What is the risk to my staff and providers? There is still much to learn about COVID-19. Based on what is currently known, spread is thought to occur mostly through respiratory droplets. Infectious secretions include sputum, serum, blood and respiratory droplets. If close contact occurs while not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, health care providers may be at risk of infection.
 What steps can healthcare providers take to protect staff? Some things providers and practices can do to protect staff include:

Review infection prevention and control guidelines on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.
Enforce proper hand hygiene practices before and after all patient contact.
Ask patients with respiratory symptoms to wear a mask and/or separate them from other patients and staff.
Assess and triage patients with acute respiratory symptoms and risk factors for COVID-19. Ideally, do this before they enter the facility.
Use standard and transmission-based precautions when caring for possible COVID-19 patients.
Consider using telemedicine to evaluate suspected cases of COVID-19.
Consider screening staff for symptoms prior to entering the clinical area.

 Should I send my patients that need COVID-19 testing to the Wake County Health Department for testing? Medical providers can test patients using the LabCorp test. Providers should NOT send patients to the Wake County Health Department to be tested as public health is prioritizing testing for high-risk individuals and health care workers.
 Are there any other resources available to evaluate patients? As of March 24, local hospital systems have established evaluation pathways for possible COVID-19 patients (see press release from March 17 and below). Understand that these pathways may change in the coming days, based on the recently released guidance from NCDHHS.
 UNC Health UNC Health patients with coronavirus symptoms should call their primary care provider’s office to determine if and where they should be tested for COVID-19. This may result in a referral to a UNC Health Respiratory Diagnostic Center or to a UNC Virtual Care center.
UNC Health patients can also call a UNC Health Helpline at 1-888-850-2684 before visiting a doctor’s office or an urgent care location. Please note: This HelpLine is experiencing high volumes of calls.
The current hours for UNC Health Respiratory Diagnostic Centers are 8 a.m.–5 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 8 a.m.–noon Saturday and Sunday.
 WakeMed Health & Hospitals WakeMed is no longer operating its Respiratory Diagnostic Center. Patients can call the WakeMed Health Help Line at 919-350-5200 between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. to connect with a provider for an initial phone evaluation.
WakeMed Virtual Urgent Care can also help evaluate COVID-19 risks, assess symptoms and provide support by video to help you find the most appropriate level of care while minimizing exposure.
You can be seen online 24/7 using a smartphone, tablet or computer without leaving home. Consults are available on-demand, and no appointment is necessary. To get started, visit wakemed.org/virtual-urgent-care or download the WakeMed All Access App.
 Duke Health Duke Primary Care and Urgent Care have opened dedicated Respiratory Care Centers to diagnose and address people experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms. People who are experiencing symptoms can call the Duke Health COVID-19 hotline at 919-385-0429 between 8 a.m. -- 8 p.m. seven days a week. Nurses will triage callers and advise on whether self-quarantine, tele-medicine or in-person appointments are recommended.
You can learn more about Duke Health's COVID-19 response  here.
 Conserving Personal Protective Equipment Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE, is in short supply across the country. That’s why Wake County strongly encourages healthcare providers who request PPE from the county to develop a conservation plan.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers guidance on how to optimize your use of PPE and encourages you to implement a plan now if you haven’t already. The website includes a burn rate calculator and advice on how to safely decontaminate and reuse PPE, as well.
 Should I order COVID-19 antibody tests for patients? If you suspect someone has current COVID-19 infection, the standard diagnostic test is viral PCR. Antibody testing should not be used for purposes of diagnosis. Providers should understand the limitations of any test they might order. Right now, there’s not enough known about the test to determine its accuracy. It’s unknown whether the test can tell the difference between past infections from SARS-CoV-2 and the six other coronaviruses. It’s also too soon to know whether the presence of antibodies means a patient is immune to a second infection.
 Should I send the results of antibody tests to the Wake County Division of Public Health or the state Division of Health and Human Services? No. At this time, COVID-19 antibody test results are not reportable. However, COVID-19 RT-PCR positive results must be reported to Wake County Public Health. You may FAX results to 919-743-7362.

Guidance for Faith-Based Communities




At a time when many people are looking to religion for spiritual support, COVID-19 is making it difficult for faith-based communities to serve their members. We understand this, and that’s why – as the state begins its phased approach to reopening – we’re encouraging faith organizations to start planning now to safely welcome members back into their facilities.
We’ve created a video, featuring County Manager David Ellis and Public Health Director Regina Petteway, that speaks specifically to this planning effort. It offers guidance and resources to help faith-based communities take the right steps to ensure members can socially distance, sanitize their hands and avoid contact when in-person services are allowed to begin again.

We encourage you to share this video with your faith organization and its leadership. We’re all in this together, and the more we do in partnership to protect each other from this virus, the better for everyone.

Wake County FAQs

 


North Carolina has moved into Phase 2 of the Governor’s plans to reopen. During this phase, the Stay-at-Home order has been lifted, but some restrictions are still in place for residents and businesses.

 Safer-at-Home OrderOther COVID-19-Related FAQsWake Forward FAQsSafer-at-Home Order


 What is NOT allowed under the safer-at-home order? As of May 1, Wake County has been following the statewide stay-at-home order issued by Gov. Roy Cooper. For more information, call the state’s hotline at 2-1-1 or consult its frequently asked questions.
On May 8, the Governor’s phased approach to easing restrictions of travel, business operations and gatherings went into effect with Phase 1.
On May 22, the Governor’s approach to easing restrictions lifted the stay-at-home order and enter Phase 2 of reopening.
Under the current order:

Restaurants can reopen dining rooms at 50% capacity. All staff must wear face coverings and practice strict cleaning procedures.
Personal care businesses, including barber shops, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlors, tanning salons and massage therapists, must also operate at 50 percent capacity. These businesses must be by appointment only.
Bars, nightclubs, gyms and health clubs must remain closed.
Pools may reopen at 50 percent capacity.
Overnight and day camps can open with safety rules.
Movie theaters, bowling alleys, and other indoor entertainment venues remain closed.
Playgrounds will also stay closed.

 What types of gatherings are banned? Gatherings of more than 10 people in a single indoor space remains prohibited. In outdoor spaces, gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited.
 Can construction and landscaping continue? Yes. Residential and commercial construction and landscaping are essential services.
 Can I still attend church or another religious service? The mass gathering limit and other requirements of Phase 2 do not apply to worship, religious and spiritual gatherings, funeral ceremonies, wedding ceremonies and other activities constituting the exercise of First Amendment rights.
Individuals are encouraged to follow the Three Ws to reduce the chance of spreading COVID-19. Read more information here.
 We had a death in the family. Can we hold a funeral? Yes, but attendees should maintain social distancing. Funeral homes, crematoriums, cemeteries and providers of mortuary services are essential services.
 What types of sporting activities are allowed? Can I play golf or tennis? Public and private gatherings of 25 or more people are prohibited outdoors. However, spending time outdoors and exercising are important for maintaining physical and mental health. While private sporting facilities are closed, we encourage families to take advantage of public recreation areas for activities that allow proper social distancing. For instance, basketball and soccer games are off limits because everyone touches the same ball and players come into close contact. Families may play golf or tennis, provided facilities are open and social distancing is practiced at all times.
 What areas of the county does this apply to? The Governor's safer-at-home order applies to the entire state of North Carolina, including all areas of Wake County. 
 How does this apply to people experiencing homelessness?  The restrictions do not apply to people experiencing homelessness. We urge them to find shelter and practice social distancing as much as possible. If you or someone you know needs help, call Oak City Cares at 984-344-9599.
 What if I think my business should be closed, but they’re still asking me to report to work? Teleworking is being strongly encouraged. If you believe your business should be closed, but you are still being asked to show up to work, you should discuss it with your employer.
 Is public transit still operating? GoTriangle is continuing to update its bus and shuttle services in response to COVID-19. Changes affect the routes run by GoRaleigh, GoCary and GoWake Access, as well as routes that run beyond Wake County. Riders may call 919-485-RIDE for information.
 Do I need to wear a face covering?  Yes, on June 24, Gov. Cooper issued a statewide face mask order to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. This order states that people must wear face coverings when in public places where physical distancing is not possible.  In addition, certain businesses must have employees and customers wear face coverings.


 Other COVID-19-Related FAQs


 How is the virus spread? 

According to the CDC:


“The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person:



Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.
Maintaining good social distance (about 6 feet) is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.”



 Can the COVID-19 virus live on surfaces? According to the CDC, it may be possible for a person to "get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes."
 Who is most at risk for contracting COVID-19 in Wake County? While anyone can contract COVID-19, adults older than 65, people with underlying health conditions and pregnant women should take extra precautions as they may be at higher risk for developing serious illness associated with the disease.
 I’m worried about getting COVID-19. What can I do to keep myself and my family safe? 

Some ways to lessen your risk for getting COVID-19 include:




Staying home and using teleworking technology when possible.
Washing your hands.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Practicing social distancing and staying away from sick people.
Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces using regular household cleaning spray or wipes.





Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash.
Staying home if you’re sick and avoiding close contact with others for three days after symptoms resolve.



 What is social distancing? Social distancing is a public health strategy that prevents close contact between people with the aim to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. Tactics that people can use to support social distancing include maintaining six feet of space between each other when in public and avoiding events with large numbers of people. The goal is to slow the spread of COVID-19 so that spread is contained as much as possible and there’s less strain on our healthcare system to care for sick people. The goal is to slow the spread of COVID-19, so fewer people get sick and there’s less strain on our healthcare system. For more information, visit here.
 I have spent time with someone who has COVID-19. What should I do? If you have been in close contact with a known positive case of COVID-19, you are a good candidate for our free drive-thru testing.
You should stay home for 14 days, as much as possible, and monitor yourself for symptoms. If you develop symptoms, self-isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms and at least three days after symptoms resolve.
 Do I need to wear a mask to protect myself while in public? Facemasks should be used to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).
CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
The state of North Carolina requires face masks in public anytime you are not in a position to stay at least six feet apart.
 I’m sick with a fever, cough and shortness of breath. What should I do? If you believe you have symptoms of COVID-19, you can be tested at one of the testing locations throughout Wake County.
If serious illness develops, call your primary care provider. If you have trouble breathing, call 9-1-1.
 Are pets at risk of COVID-19? The Wake County Animal Center is monitoring how COVID-19 may affect pets, following reports of pets in the U.S. having tested positive for the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Routine testing of domestic animals for COVID-19 is not currently recommended.
Until we know more, the CDC recommends pet owners take the following precautions:

Do not let pets interact with people or other animals outside the household.
Keep cats indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet from other people and animals.
Avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.

If you have symptoms or a confirmed case of COVID-19, restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would around other people.

When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.
Avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.
Follow general guidelines for staying healthy around animals.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. In rare cases, a strain that infects animals can spread to people. The CDC does not know its exact source, but the coronavirus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19 is suspected to have originated in animals and spread to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the new coronavirus, according to the CDC. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
 My relative lives in a nursing home. I’d like to visit her, but is that safe? Visitors are not currently permitted to visit nursing homes, long-term care facilities and assisted living centers as ordered by Gov. Roy Cooper.
 I’m a caregiver for a senior citizen. Should I do anything different than usual? The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services has posted a guide for individuals and families to avoid spreading COVID-19 within the home. Just like the general public, caretakers and those who share a home with someone in the increased risk group should take steps to limit their exposure to all kinds of contagious diseases, including COVID-19. If people think they’ve contracted COVID-19, they should take steps to avoid spreading the virus to anyone else, including those in their home or care who are in the higher-risk group. The CDC has additional resources for families to avoid spreading the disease among themselves.
 I am concerned that I may have COVID-19. How can I get tested? Now that community spread has been confirmed in North Carolina, testing by Wake County is focused on those most at risk of developing serious illness, including those over the age of 65, people with underlying health conditions and pregnant women.
If you have symptoms, self-isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms. If you develop serious illness, call your primary care doctor for evaluation. If you experience difficulty breathing, call 9-1-1.
 What is community spread? Community spread means that there are COVID-19-positive people who do not know how or where they became infected with the virus.
 Why are healthcare workers focusing on testing at-risk populations? Now that North Carolina has community transmission of the virus, we have moved to a community-based mitigation strategy, aimed at decreasing the spread, especially among those most at risk of serious illness. In this phase, testing and contact tracing are more focused than in the broad-based containment approach we executed early in the outbreak. 
This change in strategy allows us to be more vigilant about conserving resources like personal protective equipment for our healthcare workers and directing testing to those more likely to become seriously ill.
 Which Wake County phone number should I call to ask questions about COVID-19 or share my concerns? We have set up a few different phone numbers depending on your question. Visit our "Contact" page to get the email address of phone number best-suited for your need.
 I’m concerned about kids who don’t have access to nutritional meals now that school is closed. How can I help? The Wake County Public School System, Wake County and its partners are working together to make sure that food is available to hungry students during these unprecedented times. If you would like to volunteer to support food distribution sites, please complete the Food Security and Access Volunteer Form.
Please direct all food donations to the Interfaith Food Shuttle or Food Bank of Central and Eastern NC.
 What is the COVID-19 antibody test? Antibody tests measure proteins called immunoglobulins, that the body produces to help fight off infections. It takes time for our immune systems to make antibodies, which is why the test is done after symptoms go away. The test helps determine if someone had an immune response to COVID-19 but does not tell us if the person has COVID-19 currently.
There is still a lot we don’t know about SarsCoV-2 or COVID-19, including interpretation of Antibody tests. According to the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), there are at least 90 tests on the market, and we don’t yet know which ones are best.
 If I test positive for the antibody, does that mean I had—or have—the virus? We aren’t sure. Right now, we don’t know enough about the test to determine its accuracy. It’s unknown whether the test can tell the difference between past infections from SARS-CoV-2 and the six other coronaviruses, four of which cause the common cold. It’s important to note that the antibody test is not a replacement for the diagnostic test.
If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, you should:

Stay away from other people for 10 days after your symptoms begin
When you no longer have symptoms, you should stay home without fever for three more days
If you feel you need medical care, call your doctor. If you have trouble breathing, call 9-1-1.

 If I test positive for the antibody, does that mean I am immune to COVID-19? No. According to the World Health Organization, there is currently not enough evidence to tell us that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection. At this point, until testing improves, and we understand more about the virus, everyone is still considered at risk.
 What can the results be used for? This test is done after recovery from COVID-19, to detect an immune response from exposure. However, until the accuracy of the tests can be determined, there’s not much health officials can do with results. At this point, residents and/or providers do not need to report their results to the Wake County Division of Public Health or the North Carolina Division of Health and Human Services.
Cautions about the use of antibody results

The presence of COVID-19 antibodies cannot currently be used to diagnose someone as having COVID-19.
Positive antibody results cannot tell us with certainty that someone is “immune” to future infection. If protection does exist, we don’t know for how long.
Positive results cannot certify people as safe to work or travel if they’ve already been sick.
Positive results cannot tell us with certainty that the antibody detected is specifically due to COVID-19, and not another coronavirus (e.g. common cold).
Negative results do not rule out the possibility of COVID-19 infection. If you have symptoms of infection, ask your doctor about testing for presence of the virus itself.

Wake County FAQs

 


North Carolina has moved into Phase 2 of the Governor’s plans to reopen. During this phase, the Stay-at-Home order has been lifted, but some restrictions are still in place for residents and businesses.

 Safer-at-Home OrderOther COVID-19-Related FAQsWake Forward FAQsSafer-at-Home Order


 What is NOT allowed under the safer-at-home order? As of May 1, Wake County has been following the statewide stay-at-home order issued by Gov. Roy Cooper. For more information, call the state’s hotline at 2-1-1 or consult its frequently asked questions.
On May 8, the Governor’s phased approach to easing restrictions of travel, business operations and gatherings went into effect with Phase 1.
On May 22, the Governor’s approach to easing restrictions lifted the stay-at-home order and enter Phase 2 of reopening.
Under the current order:

Restaurants can reopen dining rooms at 50% capacity. All staff must wear face coverings and practice strict cleaning procedures.
Personal care businesses, including barber shops, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlors, tanning salons and massage therapists, must also operate at 50 percent capacity. These businesses must be by appointment only.
Bars, nightclubs, gyms and health clubs must remain closed.
Pools may reopen at 50 percent capacity.
Overnight and day camps can open with safety rules.
Movie theaters, bowling alleys, and other indoor entertainment venues remain closed.
Playgrounds will also stay closed.

 What types of gatherings are banned? Gatherings of more than 10 people in a single indoor space remains prohibited. In outdoor spaces, gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited.
 Can construction and landscaping continue? Yes. Residential and commercial construction and landscaping are essential services.
 Can I still attend church or another religious service? The mass gathering limit and other requirements of Phase 2 do not apply to worship, religious and spiritual gatherings, funeral ceremonies, wedding ceremonies and other activities constituting the exercise of First Amendment rights.
Individuals are encouraged to follow the Three Ws to reduce the chance of spreading COVID-19. Read more information here.
 We had a death in the family. Can we hold a funeral? Yes, but attendees should maintain social distancing. Funeral homes, crematoriums, cemeteries and providers of mortuary services are essential services.
 What types of sporting activities are allowed? Can I play golf or tennis? Public and private gatherings of 25 or more people are prohibited outdoors. However, spending time outdoors and exercising are important for maintaining physical and mental health. While private sporting facilities are closed, we encourage families to take advantage of public recreation areas for activities that allow proper social distancing. For instance, basketball and soccer games are off limits because everyone touches the same ball and players come into close contact. Families may play golf or tennis, provided facilities are open and social distancing is practiced at all times.
 What areas of the county does this apply to? The Governor's safer-at-home order applies to the entire state of North Carolina, including all areas of Wake County. 
 How does this apply to people experiencing homelessness?  The restrictions do not apply to people experiencing homelessness. We urge them to find shelter and practice social distancing as much as possible. If you or someone you know needs help, call Oak City Cares at 984-344-9599.
 What if I think my business should be closed, but they’re still asking me to report to work? Teleworking is being strongly encouraged. If you believe your business should be closed, but you are still being asked to show up to work, you should discuss it with your employer.
 Is public transit still operating? GoTriangle is continuing to update its bus and shuttle services in response to COVID-19. Changes affect the routes run by GoRaleigh, GoCary and GoWake Access, as well as routes that run beyond Wake County. Riders may call 919-485-RIDE for information.
 Do I need to wear a face covering?  Yes, on June 24, Gov. Cooper issued a statewide face mask order to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. This order states that people must wear face coverings when in public places where physical distancing is not possible.  In addition, certain businesses must have employees and customers wear face coverings.


 Other COVID-19-Related FAQs


 How is the virus spread? 

According to the CDC:


“The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person:



Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.
Maintaining good social distance (about 6 feet) is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.”



 Can the COVID-19 virus live on surfaces? According to the CDC, it may be possible for a person to "get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes."
 Who is most at risk for contracting COVID-19 in Wake County? While anyone can contract COVID-19, adults older than 65, people with underlying health conditions and pregnant women should take extra precautions as they may be at higher risk for developing serious illness associated with the disease.
 I’m worried about getting COVID-19. What can I do to keep myself and my family safe? 

Some ways to lessen your risk for getting COVID-19 include:




Staying home and using teleworking technology when possible.
Washing your hands.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Practicing social distancing and staying away from sick people.
Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces using regular household cleaning spray or wipes.





Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash.
Staying home if you’re sick and avoiding close contact with others for three days after symptoms resolve.



 What is social distancing? Social distancing is a public health strategy that prevents close contact between people with the aim to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. Tactics that people can use to support social distancing include maintaining six feet of space between each other when in public and avoiding events with large numbers of people. The goal is to slow the spread of COVID-19 so that spread is contained as much as possible and there’s less strain on our healthcare system to care for sick people. The goal is to slow the spread of COVID-19, so fewer people get sick and there’s less strain on our healthcare system. For more information, visit here.
 I have spent time with someone who has COVID-19. What should I do? If you have been in close contact with a known positive case of COVID-19, you are a good candidate for our free drive-thru testing.
You should stay home for 14 days, as much as possible, and monitor yourself for symptoms. If you develop symptoms, self-isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms and at least three days after symptoms resolve.
 Do I need to wear a mask to protect myself while in public? Facemasks should be used to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).
CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
The state of North Carolina requires face masks in public anytime you are not in a position to stay at least six feet apart.
 I’m sick with a fever, cough and shortness of breath. What should I do? If you believe you have symptoms of COVID-19, you can be tested at one of the testing locations throughout Wake County.
If serious illness develops, call your primary care provider. If you have trouble breathing, call 9-1-1.
 Are pets at risk of COVID-19? The Wake County Animal Center is monitoring how COVID-19 may affect pets, following reports of pets in the U.S. having tested positive for the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Routine testing of domestic animals for COVID-19 is not currently recommended.
Until we know more, the CDC recommends pet owners take the following precautions:

Do not let pets interact with people or other animals outside the household.
Keep cats indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet from other people and animals.
Avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.

If you have symptoms or a confirmed case of COVID-19, restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would around other people.

When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.
Avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.
Follow general guidelines for staying healthy around animals.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. In rare cases, a strain that infects animals can spread to people. The CDC does not know its exact source, but the coronavirus that caused the current outbreak of COVID-19 is suspected to have originated in animals and spread to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the new coronavirus, according to the CDC. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.
 My relative lives in a nursing home. I’d like to visit her, but is that safe? Visitors are not currently permitted to visit nursing homes, long-term care facilities and assisted living centers as ordered by Gov. Roy Cooper.
 I’m a caregiver for a senior citizen. Should I do anything different than usual? The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services has posted a guide for individuals and families to avoid spreading COVID-19 within the home. Just like the general public, caretakers and those who share a home with someone in the increased risk group should take steps to limit their exposure to all kinds of contagious diseases, including COVID-19. If people think they’ve contracted COVID-19, they should take steps to avoid spreading the virus to anyone else, including those in their home or care who are in the higher-risk group. The CDC has additional resources for families to avoid spreading the disease among themselves.
 I am concerned that I may have COVID-19. How can I get tested? Now that community spread has been confirmed in North Carolina, testing by Wake County is focused on those most at risk of developing serious illness, including those over the age of 65, people with underlying health conditions and pregnant women.
If you have symptoms, self-isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms. If you develop serious illness, call your primary care doctor for evaluation. If you experience difficulty breathing, call 9-1-1.
 What is community spread? Community spread means that there are COVID-19-positive people who do not know how or where they became infected with the virus.
 Why are healthcare workers focusing on testing at-risk populations? Now that North Carolina has community transmission of the virus, we have moved to a community-based mitigation strategy, aimed at decreasing the spread, especially among those most at risk of serious illness. In this phase, testing and contact tracing are more focused than in the broad-based containment approach we executed early in the outbreak. 
This change in strategy allows us to be more vigilant about conserving resources like personal protective equipment for our healthcare workers and directing testing to those more likely to become seriously ill.
 Which Wake County phone number should I call to ask questions about COVID-19 or share my concerns? We have set up a few different phone numbers depending on your question. Visit our "Contact" page to get the email address of phone number best-suited for your need.
 I’m concerned about kids who don’t have access to nutritional meals now that school is closed. How can I help? The Wake County Public School System, Wake County and its partners are working together to make sure that food is available to hungry students during these unprecedented times. If you would like to volunteer to support food distribution sites, please complete the Food Security and Access Volunteer Form.
Please direct all food donations to the Interfaith Food Shuttle or Food Bank of Central and Eastern NC.
 What is the COVID-19 antibody test? Antibody tests measure proteins called immunoglobulins, that the body produces to help fight off infections. It takes time for our immune systems to make antibodies, which is why the test is done after symptoms go away. The test helps determine if someone had an immune response to COVID-19 but does not tell us if the person has COVID-19 currently.
There is still a lot we don’t know about SarsCoV-2 or COVID-19, including interpretation of Antibody tests. According to the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), there are at least 90 tests on the market, and we don’t yet know which ones are best.
 If I test positive for the antibody, does that mean I had—or have—the virus? We aren’t sure. Right now, we don’t know enough about the test to determine its accuracy. It’s unknown whether the test can tell the difference between past infections from SARS-CoV-2 and the six other coronaviruses, four of which cause the common cold. It’s important to note that the antibody test is not a replacement for the diagnostic test.
If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, you should:

Stay away from other people for 10 days after your symptoms begin
When you no longer have symptoms, you should stay home without fever for three more days
If you feel you need medical care, call your doctor. If you have trouble breathing, call 9-1-1.

 If I test positive for the antibody, does that mean I am immune to COVID-19? No. According to the World Health Organization, there is currently not enough evidence to tell us that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection. At this point, until testing improves, and we understand more about the virus, everyone is still considered at risk.
 What can the results be used for? This test is done after recovery from COVID-19, to detect an immune response from exposure. However, until the accuracy of the tests can be determined, there’s not much health officials can do with results. At this point, residents and/or providers do not need to report their results to the Wake County Division of Public Health or the North Carolina Division of Health and Human Services.
Cautions about the use of antibody results

The presence of COVID-19 antibodies cannot currently be used to diagnose someone as having COVID-19.
Positive antibody results cannot tell us with certainty that someone is “immune” to future infection. If protection does exist, we don’t know for how long.
Positive results cannot certify people as safe to work or travel if they’ve already been sick.
Positive results cannot tell us with certainty that the antibody detected is specifically due to COVID-19, and not another coronavirus (e.g. common cold).
Negative results do not rule out the possibility of COVID-19 infection. If you have symptoms of infection, ask your doctor about testing for presence of the virus itself.

Guidance for Nursing Homes




 What are the special restrictions for nursing homes? Nursing homes, long-term care facilities and assisted living centers must cease all group activities that don’t allow for social distancing.
 I have a relative in a nursing home. Will I still be able to visit them? 


Under the state executive order,  "long-term care facilities shall restrict visitation of all visitors and non-essential healthcare personnel, except for certain compassionate care situations, for example, and end-of-life situation."



 What can nursing homes do to limit the spread of COVID-19 in their facilities? In addition to restricting visitors, nursing homes can implement the following processes to limit the spread of COVID-19 within their facility:

If the nursing home has a positive resident, the resident should be isolated away from healthy residents. If possible, all residents and all staff should be tested for the virus, per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. If results render additional positive cases, those positive residents should be cohorted.
If nursing home staff experience symptoms of the virus, they should stay home for seven days. Once they are fever-free for three consecutive days after the start of their symptoms, they may return to work.
If staff has a negative COVID-19 test and have no symptoms, they may return to work.
If employees test positive and have no symptoms, they can return to work, but they can only support the residents who have tested positive for COVID-19 and they must wear appropriate personal protective equipment at all times per guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
