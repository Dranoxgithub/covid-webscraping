,"Although there is no  ﬁCOVID -19ﬂ standard, several OSHA standards could be applied to preventing the spread of the  disease.",polk,Iowa
,"This includes, but is not limited to, the ﬁGeneral Duty  Clauseﬂ which requires  employers to provide their workers ﬁ employment and a place of employment, which are free  from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ  29 USC 654(a)(1)  Though it would be difficult  for an employee to clearly demonstrate that they contracted the  illness while at their place of employment, contact tracing could lay a clear path back to the   workplace.",polk,Iowa
,"As we begin to repatriate our offices and bring the workforce back, there are many a dditional  considerations that may impact decisions.",polk,Iowa
,There is always a chance that employers may face   claims of discrimination while making difficult choices in how they phase in the returning work  force.,polk,Iowa
,It is impera tive that such decisions are made for  reasons  not based on a protected cl ass as  defined by  discrimination laws.,polk,Iowa
,"Specifically, employers need to  careful ly document their  selection process and avoid making any  decisions based on  age or disabilities that might be  perceived to  make an employee or  applicant more vulnerable to the virus.",polk,Iowa
,"For businesses that are forced to make a reduction in work force, these same types of   considerations should be applied.",polk,Iowa

,Have you provided proper training for use of the protective wear?,polk,Iowa

,Some basic steps may help to protect companies:  1.,polk,Iowa
,Decide who  you will screen.,polk,Iowa
,"While some companies are screening ALL employees,  others are screening only those who have been in contact with someone who has been  tested positive for COVID 19.",polk,Iowa
,Many companies are testing everyone who enters the  facility while others  do not have that option (retail stores and others with rotating  customer base where it would be impractical).,polk,Iowa

,Decide where checks will take place.,polk,Iowa
,The main cons ideration is privacy.,polk,Iowa
,The best  location would allow some discretion for the person being screened.,polk,Iowa
,"Ideally, there would  be an alternate location that anyone failing the screening could be taken to walk them  though the next steps.",polk,Iowa

,"As we begin to repatriate our offices and bring the workforce back, there are many a dditional  considerations that may impact decisions.",polk,Iowa
,There is always a chance that employers may face   claims of discrimination while making difficult choices in how they phase in the returning work  force.,polk,Iowa
,It is impera tive that such decisions are made for  reasons  not based on a protected cl ass as  defined by  discrimination laws.,polk,Iowa
,"Specifically, employers need to  careful ly document their  selection process and avoid making any  decisions based on  age or disabilities that might be  perceived to  make an employee or  applicant more vulnerable to the virus.",polk,Iowa
,"For businesses that are forced to make a reduction in work force, these same types of   considerations should be applied.",polk,Iowa
,Employees that used sick leave to care for family members or   because of concerns about their ow n well -being that are later part of a force reduction may  consider this a retaliation or retribution by the employer.,polk,Iowa
,"Personal Protective Equipment:  Many employers are considering placement of policies or protocols that include the wearing of   facemasks,  gloves or other protective equipment to help stop the spread of any illness in their  workplace.",polk,Iowa

,Have you provided proper training for use of the protective wear?,polk,Iowa

,"As the disaster continues and a new normal emerges, there may be a review of these  procedures which may cause problems if not implemented correctly.",polk,Iowa
,Some basic steps may help to protect companies:  1.,polk,Iowa
,Decide who  you will screen.,polk,Iowa
,"While some companies are screening ALL employees,  others are screening only those who have been in contact with someone who has been  tested positive for COVID 19.",polk,Iowa
,Many companies are testing everyone who enters the  facility while others  do not have that option (retail stores and others with rotating  customer base where it would be impractical).,polk,Iowa

,The main cons ideration is privacy.,polk,Iowa
,The best  location would allow some discretion for the person being screened.,polk,Iowa
,"Ideally, there would  be an alternate location that anyone failing the screening could be taken to walk them  though the next steps.",polk,Iowa

,"As we begin to repatriate our offices and bring the workforce back, there are many a dditional  considerations that may impact decisions.",polk,Iowa
,There is always a chance that employers may face   claims of discrimination while making difficult choices in how they phase in the returning work  force.,polk,Iowa
,It is impera tive that such decisions are made for  reasons  not based on a protected cl ass as  defined by  discrimination laws.,polk,Iowa
,"Specifically, employers need to  careful ly document their  selection process and avoid making any  decisions based on  age or disabilities that might be  perceived to  make an employee or  applicant more vulnerable to the virus.",polk,Iowa

,"Here™s a quick summary of the  key steps, and in the pages that follow we™ll explore them  all in more depth : F = Focus on what ™s in your control  A = Acknowledge your thoughts  & feelings  C = Co me back into  your body  E = Engage in  what you™re doing   C = Committed action  O = Open ing  up   V = Values  I =  Identify resources  D = Disinfect &  distance    Let™s now explore these, one by  one   F = Focus on what™s in your control  The Corona crisis can affect us in many different ways: physically, emotionally,  economic ally, socially,  and psychologically.",polk,Iowa
,"All of us  are (or  soon will be) dealing with  the  very real  challenge s of  widespread  serious illness  and  the  inabilities of healthcare  systems  to  cope with it , social and community  disruption , economic fallout and  financial problems  , obstacles and interruptions  to many aspects of life  – and the list goes on.",polk,Iowa
,"And w hen  we are facing a cris is of any sort, fear and anxiety are inevitable; they are normal,  natural responses  to challenging situations infused with danger and uncertaint y.  It™s all too  easy to get lost in worrying and ruminating about all sorts of things that are out of your   contr ol: what might happen in the future; how the virus might affect you or your loved ones  or your community or your country or the world  Œ and what will happen then  - and so on.",polk,Iowa
,"And while it™s  completely  natural  for us  to get lost in such worries, it™s not us eful or helpful.",polk,Iowa
,"Indeed the more  we focus on what™s  not  in our control, the more h opeless  or  anxious  we™re  likely to feel.",polk,Iowa
,So the  single most useful thing anyone can do in any type of crisis  Œ Corona -related or  otherwise  -  is to:  focus on what™s in your control.,polk,Iowa
,You can™t control what happens in the future.,polk,Iowa
,You can™t control Corona virus itself or the  world economy or  how  your gover nment manage s this whole sordid mess.,polk,Iowa
,"And y ou can™t  magically control your feelings ,  eliminat ing  all that perfectly natural fear and anxiety.",polk,Iowa
,But  you can control  what you do  - here and now .,polk,Iowa
,An d that matters.,polk,Iowa
,"Because  what you do  - here and now  - can  make a  huge  difference to yourself, and anyone  living  with you, and  a significant difference to  the community around you.",polk,Iowa
,"© Russ Harris, 2020  www.TheHappinessTrap.com   www.ImLearningACT.com    The reality is,  we  all  have far more control over our  behaviour,  than we do over our  thoughts and feelings.",polk,Iowa
,So our number one aim is to take control of our  behaviour  - right  here and now  - to  respond  effective ly to this crisis.,polk,Iowa
,This involves both dealing with our inner world  Œ all our difficult thoughts and feelings  - and  our outer world  Œ all the real problems w e are facing.,polk,Iowa
,How do we do this?,polk,Iowa
,"Well, w hen a big  storm blows up, the boats in the harbour drop anchor  Œ because if they don™t, they™ll get  swept out to sea.",polk,Iowa
,"And of course,  dropping anchor doesn™t make  the  storm go away (anchors  can™t control the weather)  - but it  can hold a  boat steady in the harbour, until the storm  passes in its own good time.",polk,Iowa
,"Similarly, in  an ongoing crisis, we™re all going to experience  ‚emotional storm s™: unhelpful  thoughts spinning inside our head , and  painful feelings whirling around our body.",polk,Iowa
,"And  if we™re swept away by th at storm  inside us , there™s nothing effective we can do .",polk,Iowa
,"So the first  practical step is to ‚drop anchor™, using the simple ACE formula:   A = Acknowledge your thoughts and feelings  C = Come back into your body  E = Engage in what you™re doing   Let™s explore these one by one:   A = Acknowledge your thoughts and feelings  Silently and kindly acknowledge whatever is ‚showing up™ inside you: thoughts, feelings,  emotions, memories,  sensation,  urges.",polk,Iowa
,"Take the stance of a curious scientist, observing  what™s going on in your inner world.",polk,Iowa
,"And while continuing to acknowledge your thoughts and feelings, also ....   C = Come back into your body  Come back into and connect with your physical body.",polk,Iowa
,Find your own way of doing this.,polk,Iowa
,"You   could try some or all of  the following, or find your own methods:  Ł Slowly pushing your feet hard into the floor.",polk,Iowa
,"Ł Slowly straightening up your back and spine; if sit ting, sitting upright and forward in your  chair.",polk,Iowa
,"Ł Slowly pressing your fingertips together  Ł Slowly stretching your arms or neck, shrugging your shoulders.",polk,Iowa
,"Ł Slowly breathing  © Russ Harris, 2020  www.TheHappinessTrap.com   www.ImLearningACT.com    Note: you are not trying to turn away from, escape, avoid or distract yourself f rom what is  happening in your inner  world.",polk,Iowa
,"The aim is to remain aware of your thoughts and feelings,  continue to acknowledge their presence .... and at  the same time, come back into and  connect with your body , and  actively mov e it.",polk,Iowa
,Why?,polk,Iowa
,"So you can gain as  much control as  possible over your physical actions , even though you can™t control your feelings.",polk,Iowa
,"(Remember, F = Focus on what™s in your control)  And  as you  acknowledg e your thoughts  & feelings, and co me back into  your body, also ....   E = Engage in what y ou™re doing  Get a sense of where you are and refocus your attention on the activity you are doing.",polk,Iowa
,Find your own way of doing this.,polk,Iowa
,"You could try some or all of  the following suggestions, or  find your own methods:  Ł Look around the room and notice 5 things you can see.",polk,Iowa
,Ł Notice 3 or 4 things you can hear.,polk,Iowa
,Ł Notice what you can smell or taste or sense in your nose and mouth  Ł Notice what you are doing  Ł End the ex ercise by giving your full attention to the task or activity at hand.,polk,Iowa
,"(And if you  don™t have any meaningful activity to do, see the next 3 steps.)",polk,Iowa
,"Ideally, run through the ACE cycle slowly 3 or 4 times, to turn it into a 2 - 3 minute exercise.",polk,Iowa
,"If you wish,  to help you get the hang of this,  you can download some free audio recordings  of ‚dropping anchor™ exercises, varying from 1 minute to  11 minutes in length.",polk,Iowa
,You can listen  to these and use them as a guide to help you develop this skill.,polk,Iowa
,"You ca n download or stream  them from the left hand box on this  webpage:  https://www.actmindfully.com.au/free -stuff/free -audio/  NOTE: please don™t skip the A of ACE; it™s so important to keep  acknowledging the thoughts  and feelings present,  especially if they are difficult or uncomfortable.",polk,Iowa
,"If you skip the A, this  exercise will turn into a distraction technique  Œ which it™s not supposed to be.",polk,Iowa
,Dropping anchor is a very useful skill.,polk,Iowa
,"You can use it for handling difficult thoughts, feelings,   emotions, memories, urges and sensations more effectively; switching off auto -pilot and  engaging in life; grounding and steadying yourself in difficult situat ions; disrupting   rumination, obsessing and worrying; and focusing your attention on the task or activity you   are doing.",polk,Iowa
,"The better you anchor yourself in the here and now, the more control you have  over your actions  Œ which makes it a lot easier to do the  next steps:  COVID      © Russ Harris, 2020  www.TheHappinessTrap.com   www.ImLearningACT.com    C =  Committed Action   Committed action means e ffective action, guided by your core values; action you take  because it™s truly important to you; action you take even if it brings up difficult thoughts and   feelings.",polk,Iowa
,"Once you have  dropped anchor, using the ACE formula, you will have a lot of  control over your actions  Œ so this makes it easier to  do the things that  truly  matter.",polk,Iowa

,"18  Legal Considerations of ﬁBack to Workﬂ   Generally  Speaking:  Employers may face liability under O ccupational  Safety and  Health  Administration (OSHA)  regulations for actions taken before, during and after the COVID -19 crisis.",polk,Iowa
,"Although there is no  ﬁCOVID -19ﬂ standard, several OSHA standards could be applied to preventing the spread of the  disease.",polk,Iowa
,"This includes, but is not limited to, the ﬁGeneral Duty Clauseﬂ which requires  employers to provide their workers ﬁ employment and a  place of employment, which are free  from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.ﬂ  29 USC 654(a)(1)  Though it would be difficult for an employee to clearly demonstrate that they contracted the   illness whil e at their place of employment, contact tracing could lay a clear path back to the   workplace.",polk,Iowa
,"As we begin to repatriate our offices and bring the workforce back, there are many additional   considerations that may impact decisions.",polk,Iowa
,There is always a chanc e that employers may face  claims of discrimination while making difficult choices in how they phase in the returning work  force.,polk,Iowa
,It is impera tive that such decisions are made for reasons  not based on a protected cl ass as  defined by  discrimination laws.,polk,Iowa
,"Specifically, employers need to  careful ly document their  selection process and avoid making any  decisions based on  age or disabilities that might be  perceived to  make an employee or applicant more vulnerable to the virus.",polk,Iowa
,"For businesses that are forced to ma ke a reduction in work force, these same types of   considerations should be applied.",polk,Iowa
,Employees that used sick leave to care for family members or   because of concerns about their own well -being that are later part of a force reduction may  consider this a re taliation or retribution by the employer.,polk,Iowa
,"Personal Protective Equipment:  Many employers are considering placement of policies or protocols that include the wearing of   facemasks, gloves or other protective equipment to help stop the spread of any illness  in their  workplace.",polk,Iowa
,"While the intent is well placed, certain considerations should be made:   Have you accounted for those with access and functional needs?",polk,Iowa
,"This may include things  like protective wear for those who use wheelchairs, options for those with  allergies to  latex, etc.",polk,Iowa
,Have you provided proper training for use of the protective wear?,polk,Iowa
,Improper donning and  doffing of protective equipment is often the cause of infection among medical   professionals.,polk,Iowa
,Can you provide fit testing for masks?,polk,Iowa
,"Legall y, if the employer can accommodate these types of exceptions or alternatives without  causing undue hardship to the business, they are required to do so.",polk,Iowa
,19   Screening and other access controls  Even those things that are intende d to protect the work force  may cause legal issues if not  completed correctly.,polk,Iowa
,"Currently, under the medical emergency, leniencies have been provided  to companies in the interest of protecting the general public from COVID -19.",polk,Iowa
,"As the disaster continues and a new normal emerges, there  may be a review of these  procedures which may cause problems if not implemented correctly.",polk,Iowa
,Some basic steps may help to protect companies:  1.,polk,Iowa
,Decide who you will screen.,polk,Iowa
,"While some companies are screening ALL employees,  others are screening only those who  have been in contact with someone who has been  tested positive for COVID 19.",polk,Iowa
,Many companies are testing everyone who enters the  facility while others do not have that option (retail stores and others with rotating  customer base where it would be impractic al).,polk,Iowa
,One of the most important considerations  is consistency and assurance that the testing is completed on a nondiscriminatory basis.,polk,Iowa
,2.,polk,Iowa
,Training for those who are doing the screening.,polk,Iowa
,"Again, there are differences in how   companies are doing the screening.",polk,Iowa
,Some companies are allowing employees to take  their own temperature while others are providing a trained employee to take all   temperatures.,polk,Iowa
,Still others are hiring third party contractors for this purpose.,polk,Iowa
,"Whichever  method you choose, maintain records t o ensure discrimination has not taken place.",polk,Iowa

,Consider what type of thermometers will be used and be consistent.,polk,Iowa
,"Speed,   accuracy and ease of use are main considerations for most of the businesses  implementing checks.",polk,Iowa
,5.,polk,Iowa
,Decide where checks will take place.,polk,Iowa
,The main consideration is privacy.,polk,Iowa
,The best   location would allow some discretion for the person being screened.,polk,Iowa
,"Idea lly, there would  be an alternate location that anyone failing the screening could be taken to walk them   though the next steps.",polk,Iowa
,6.,polk,Iowa
,Develop a screening process or policy and stick to it.,polk,Iowa
,7.,polk,Iowa
,Develop a documentation process.,polk,Iowa
,8.,polk,Iowa
,Communicate the processes to your employ ees prior to implementation.,polk,Iowa

,10.,polk,Iowa
,Establish return to work procedure and communicate that with employees.,polk,Iowa

,"2  YOUR SCORES ON THE PROQOL: PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE SCREENING  Based on your responses, place  your personal scores below.",polk,Iowa
,"If you have any  concerns, you should  discuss them with a  physical or mental health care professional.",polk,Iowa
,Compassion Satisfaction _____________ Compassion satisfaction is about the pleasure you derive from  being able to do your work well.,polk,Iowa
,"For example, you may feel  like it is a pleasure to help others through your work.",polk,Iowa
,Yo u may feel positively about your  colleagues or your ability to  contribute to the work setting or even  the greater good of society.,polk,Iowa
,Higher s cores on this scale represent a greater  satisfaction related to your ability to be an effective caregiver in your job.,polk,Iowa
,The average score is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .88).,polk,Iowa
,About 25% of people score higher than 57 and about 25% of  people score below 43.,polk,Iowa
,"If you are in the higher range, you pr obably derive a good deal of professional satisfaction from  your position.",polk,Iowa
,"If your scores are below 40, you may either fi nd problems with your job, or there may be some other  reasonŠfor example, you might  derive your satisfaction from activities other than your job.",polk,Iowa
,Burnout_____________ Most people have an intuitive idea of what burnout is.,polk,Iowa
,"From  the research perspective, burnout is one of the elements of  Compassion Fatigue (CF).",polk,Iowa
,It is associated  with feelings of hopelessne ss and difficulties in dealing  with work or in doing your  job effectively.,polk,Iowa
,These negative feelings usually have a gradual on set.,polk,Iowa
,"They can reflect the feeling that your efforts make no  difference, or they can be associated with a very high work load or a non-supportive work  environment.",polk,Iowa
,Higher scores on  this scale mean that you are at higher risk for burnout.,polk,Iowa
,The average score on the burnout scale is 50 (SD 10; alpha sc ale reliability .75).,polk,Iowa
,About 25% of people score above 57 and  about 25% of people score below 43.,polk,Iowa
,"If your score is below 43,  this probably reflects positive feelings about your ability to  be effective in your work.",polk,Iowa
,If you score above 57 you may wish to think about what at work makes you feel like you are not  effective in your position.,polk,Iowa
,Your score may reflect your mood; pe rhaps you were having a ﬁbad dayﬂ or are in need of some  time off.,polk,Iowa
,"If the high score persists or if it is reflective of other worries, it may be a cause for concern.",polk,Iowa
,Secondary Traumatic Stress_____________ The second component of Compassion Fati gue (CF) is secondary traumatic stress (STS).,polk,Iowa
,"It is about your work related,  secondary exposure to extremely or traumatically stressful events.",polk,Iowa
,Developing problems due to exposure to other™s  trauma is somewhat rare but does happen to many peop le who care for those who have experienced extremely or  traumatically stressful events.,polk,Iowa
,"For example, you may repeatedly  hear stories about the traumatic things that happen to  other people, commonly called Vicarious Traumatization.",polk,Iowa
,"If your work  puts you directly in the path of danger, for example,  field work in a war or area of civil violence, this is not se condary exposure; your exposure is primary.",polk,Iowa
,"However, if you are  exposed to others™ traumatic events as a result of your work,  for example, as a therapist or  an emergency worker, this is  secondary exposure.",polk,Iowa
,The symptoms of STS are usually rapid in  onset and associated with a particular event.,polk,Iowa
,"They may  include being afraid, having difficulty sleeping, having images  of the upsetting event pop into your mind, or avoiding things  that remind you of the event.",polk,Iowa
,The average score on this scale is 50 (SD 10; alpha scale reliability .81).,polk,Iowa
,About 25% of people score below 43 and about  25% of people score above 57.,polk,Iowa
,"If your score is above 57, you ma y want to take some time to think about what at work may  be frightening to you or if there is some  other reason for the elevated score.",polk,Iowa
,"While  higher scores do not mean that you do  have a problem, they are an indication  that you may want to examine how you  feel about your work and your work  environment.",polk,Iowa
,"You may wish to discuss this with your su pervisor, a colleague, or a health care professional.",polk,Iowa
