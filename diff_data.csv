,"### LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER DIRECTIVE Whereas , on February 29, 2020, Governor Jay Inslee proclaimed a state of emergency within the State of Washington due to COVID -19; and Whereas , on March 14, 2020, the first confirmed cases of COVID -19 were identified in Spokane County; and Whereas a state of emergency within Spokane County due to COVID -19 was declared on March 20, 2020; and Whereas , on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a state of pandemic due to COVID -19; and Whereas, on March 13, 2020, President Donald Trump declared a National Emergency due to COVID -19, and on March 22, 2020 a Major Disaster was declared for the State of Washington; and Whereas , on March 23, 2020, Governor Inslee imposed a ﬁStay Home Œ Stay Healthyﬂ Order throughout Washington State prohibiting all people in Washington State from leaving their homes or place of residence except (1) to conduct or participate in essential activities and/or (2) for employment in essential services, thus precluding participation in social, spiritual, and recreational gatherings of any kind regardless of the number of participants, and closing all non -essential businesses in Washington State; and Whereas , on May 4, 2020, Governor Inslee issued a Proclamation modifying his ﬁStay Home Œ Stay Healthyﬂ Order, with a phased -in approach to re -open Washington, which will increase the number of interactions among Spokane County residents and the frequency of their encounters with non -household members, and will increase their risk of exposure to persons with infec tious COVID -19; and Whereas , the age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the population of Spokane County and its local cities and towns places it at risk for serious health complications, including death, from COVID -19; and Whereas, a large surge in the number of persons with serious infections can compromise the ability of the regional healthcare system to deliver necessary healthcare to the public; and Whereas , individuals can be infected and contagious before or even without developing symptoms (pre -symptomatic and asymptomatic), and the evidence suggests a significant number of infections may be transmitted in this manner; and Whereas, the United States Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (ﬁCDCﬂ) confirmed that a significant number of individuals who are infected remain asymptomatic and that as many as 25 percent of these individuals may contribute to transmission of the SARS -CoV -2 virus; and Whereas , on e key transmission method for COVID -19 is respiratory droplets that individuals expel when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze; and Whereas , the CDC recommends that members of the public should cover their noses and mouths with a cloth face covering to pre vent inadvertently spreading COVID -19 while interacting with others outside their homes in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain; and wearing a fabric mask can help prevent the spread of infection to others when t he mask is worn by someone who already is infected with the virus that causes COVID -19, even Local Health Office Order - COVID -19 Face Covering Directive May 20, 2020 if they don't have symptoms.",spokane,Washington
,"The mask could help by blocking infectious droplets from spreading when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes, breathes or speaks ; and Whereas, there is a national shortage of medical grade masks, surgical masks, and N -95 respirators that are critically needed for healthcare providers who are on the front lines working to protect all of us, and health officials are increasingl y urgi ng non -medical workers to wear non -medical grade cloth face coverings to help curb the spread of COVID -19; and Whereas , workers of certain essential businesses and other frontline employees must be protected because they face greater exposure and risk of contracting COVID -19 due to their frequent in person contact with members of the public and inability to work from home and widespread mask use may decrease the risk of spread from someone with unrecognized infection; and Whereas , there is a long history of racism and discriminatory policies that Native, People of Color, immigrant and refugee, LGBTQ communities, homeless , and other marginalized communities have faced in Washington state that may impact an individual™s ability to feel safe while wearing a face covering; and Whereas , Spokane County government is dedicated to providing all its residents with fair and equal access to services, opportunities, and protection; invit ing and encouraging public engagement; and reflecting consideration for cultural differences; and Whereas , the Revised Code of Washington, Title 70.05.070(2) -(3), requires and empowers the local health officer to take such action as is necessary to maintain health and to control and prevent the spread of any contagious or infectious diseases within the jurisdi ction; and Whereas, the Washington Administrative Code, Title 246 -100 -036, requires the local health officer, when necessary, to institute disease control measures as he or she deems necessary based on his or her professional judgment, current standards o f practice, and the best available medical and scientific information; and Based upon the above, as the Local Health Officer, I hereby find that directing the population of Spokane County to wear face coverings in certain public places is reasonable and conducive to maintain health and to the control and prevention throughout Spokane County of COVID -19, a contagious and infectious disease.",spokane,Washington
