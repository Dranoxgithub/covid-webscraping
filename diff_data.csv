Interviewers can also help connect people with resources they may need while they quarantine for 14 days if they are not sick or isolate at home until they fully recover.What is a case investigation? When public health learns about a positive COVID-19 case, an interviewer contacts the person to investigate. What is contact tracing? Interviewers work with a person who tests positive for COVID-19 to determine their close contacts –anyone who was within 6 feet of them for 15 minutes or more while they were infectious. Interviewers then contact people who were close contacts to let them know they may have been exposed to COVID-19.What questions does the interviewer ask? Interviewers asks pre-approved questions for case investigations and contact tracing. They ask the person for their date of birth, address, gender at birth, race, ethnicity, and other questions. Interviewers don’t ask for information like immigration status, Social Security number, financial information, or marital status.Who do they share my information with?

,"Does COVID-19 spread more easily indoors?The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads in droplets in the breath, sneezes, laughs, and coughs of infected people. The virus spreads more easily in poor ventilation and with limited access to fresh air. In outdoor settings, more fresh air circulates and people have more space to physically distance from others. Indoors, there is less air circulation in confined spaces making transmission of the virus easier.How do I report a private group not following the mask requirement?If the report is about a private group not following the proclamation, contact your local law enforcement agency. DO NOT call 911. Refer to the law enforcement agency website for directions on how to file a complaint or use the agency’s non-emergency number.How do we know cloth face coverings work?Researchers reviewed the scientific literature looking at the effectiveness of surgical masks and cloth face coverings. They found that the masks and cloth face coverings were effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19 — if we wear them! The biggest limitation to their effectiveness was inconsistent mask use.I find wearing a mask irritates my skin.  What should I do?You could get a skin irritation or rash while wearing a mask. Keep your face covering clean and dry; wash it every day.  Keep your face clean and well moisturized. If you find a face covering irritating, consider whether you may react to the soap you use to wash it or the type of fabric. To prevent skin irritations or acne, you might avoid wearing makeup under your mask. Switch to a different face covering if the one you wear gets damp.I see somebody not wearing a face covering in public. What should I do?  Nothing. People with certain medical conditions or other circumstances are exempt from the requirement to wear a face covering.  Be sure to wear your face covering and stay 6 feet away.I would rather just cover my mouth.  Does that help? In a word, no. COVID-19 spreads through droplets. Droplets come out of our nose when we breathe. To be effective, a mask must cover both the nose and mouth. If I’m healthy, do I still need to wear a mask? Yes. You can have COVID-19 and still feel fine, healthy, or normal. Infected people who do not experience symptoms still can spread the disease. Wear a mask to protect your friends and neighbors. Is physical distancing still required if I’m wearing a mask?Yes. We wear cloth face coverings to help us keep our breath, and the potentially infections droplets it contains, to ourselves. Face coverings are just one way to do that. They work best if you also stand 6 feet away from other people. Physical distancing, hand washing, staying home if sick, and getting tested for COVID-19—even if you have mild symptoms—are all important to do, even if you cover your face.Should I wear a mask?A Washington State order requires everyone to wear a face covering when you:",pierce
