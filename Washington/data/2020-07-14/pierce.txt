Our FAQs answer dozens of your most-asked questions. You can find some of our more-asked answers below or visit our FAQ page for many more.



FAQs





            What are COVID-19 symptoms?
        



People with COVID-19 reported a range of symptoms that can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure:

Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell.







            How does COVID-19 spread?
        



COVID-19 can spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks near others, or through close personal contact like shaking hands. You can also get it when you touch something that has the virus on it, then touch your mouth, nose or eyes before you wash your hands. The virus can spread before people show symptoms.






            Should I wear a mask?
        



A Washington State order requires everyone to wear a face covering when you:

Are in indoor public spaces like stores, offices, businesses or restaurants.
Can't stay 6 feet or more apart outdoors.

 A mask or face covering is an extra layer of protection and isn’t a substitute for physical distance or handwashing. We recommend you save N95 or other medical-grade masks intended for healthcare workers.






            I think I have COVID-19. What should I do?
        



View our infographic. Talk to your healthcare provider. He or she will be able to determine if you should be tested.  If you suspect you have COVID-19 follow these steps to prevent the spread of disease:


Stay home except to get medical care.


People who have mild cases of COVID-19 can isolate at home during their illness. Restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Don’t go to work, school, or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.


Separate yourself from other people in your home. 


Stay in a specific room and away from other people and animals in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available.
Monitor your symptoms.
Seek prompt medical attention if your illness get worse. COVID-19 symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure:


Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell.


Call ahead before you visit your doctor or an emergency room.
If you have a medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider take steps to prevent exposure to other people.






            Can I get COVID-19 from a surface or object?
        



We are learning that COVID-19 lives on surfaces for varied periods of time depending on the material. 
Make sure to wash your hands frequently when in public places. See our guidance for how to clean and disinfect for COVID-19. 






            Where can I get tested for COVID-19?
        



Start with your healthcare provider. Both CHI Franciscan and MultiCare Health System offer free virtual appointments to people who believe they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. If needed, the healthcare provider will refer you for testing. 
Community Health Care offers testing, even if you are not their patient. Visit their website to see if you qualify and to make an appointment. 
If you don’t have a healthcare provider, visit our healthcare and help page.  






            Do you have a long-term plan for investigating COVID-19 in Pierce County?
        




Yes. You can read more about our disease investigation team and learn about our COVID19-Public Health Long-Term Testing and Investigation Response Strategy. 







            I don’t have a primary care provider. Where can I find one?
        



            Check out our free or low-cost health resources to help you thrive. Only use the emergency department for emergency medical care.
        





            What is antibody testing? 
        




Antibody tests check your blood for antibodies, which show if you had a previous infection with a virus. Antibodies are proteins that help your body fight off infections. This is also called a serology test. Serum is the technical word for blood fluid. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody test. Learn more about antibody testing on the CDC’s website.  







            What underlying medical conditions put me at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19?
        



COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning the risk factors for severe disease.  Some high-risk health conditions include:

Heart disease.
Diabetes.
Lung disease.
HIV.
Asthma. 
Pregnancy. 
Auto-immune disorders.
Recent surgery.
Cancer treatment.
Severe obesity.







            Where can I find information about volunteering?
        



Many nonprofits need your help. Learn where you can safely volunteer. United Way of Pierce County has several volunteer opportunities. Visit their website to learn more or to recruit volunteers.

Testing plays an important role in slowing the spread of COVID-19.
Contact your healthcare provider to get tested. The Health Department doesn’t offer tests for the public.
Consider getting tested if any of the following apply, even if you don’t have COVID-19 symptoms.

You might have contacted a person who has COVID-19.
You could not maintain safe physical distance from others at a gathering.
You are a member of the hardest hit communities—Black, Latinx, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Island, American Indian, Alaska Native.

Call ahead to ensure your healthcare provider has resources to test asymptomatic people.
Most health insurance plans cover testing and treatment for services necessary for COVID-19. The state insurance commissioner ordered all health plans his office regulates to waive copays, coinsurance and deductibles for people requiring testing for COVID-19. Copays and deductibles will still apply if you need treatment.
Tests are usually PCR (polymerase chain reaction) swabs and can be self-collected. Call the provider for more details.

Time to Mask Up, Pierce County.

The state now requires people in Washington to wear face coverings in public spaces. The state Secretary of Health enacted the public health order June 26, 2020. The Secretary of Health said starting July 7, businesses can't service customers unless they wear face coverings. These orders are in place until the state Department of Health tells us otherwise. Scroll down to read about exemptions.
Face coverings need to become a part of our new normal. Because we must stop the spread of disease to recover economically and return to normal life. We get a lot of questions about mask use. To answer some, we’re offering advice and tips we learned along the way.


A long, long time ago. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended wearing face coverings or masks in public in early April. Face coverings should consist of two layers of fabric and cover both the nose and mouth.

You don’t need to wear a face covering at home or when alone in a private space like a car or office. But you should wear one when you’re out and about. Wearing really is caring.

Guidance from the CDC and state Department of Health tell us wearing a face covering of any kind is another tool to limit the spread of COVID-19:

 It’s still critical to wash hands, cover coughs and follow physical distancing measures.
Stay close to home.
Limit gatherings to 5 or fewer people from outside your home per week.
Conserve medical-grade masks for healthcare workers and first responders only.
Don’t put masks on children younger than 2 or anyone with certain disabilities or health conditions. The state recommends but does not require children younger than 5 to wear masks in public places. The state requires children 5 and older to wear face coverings in public when distancing cannot be safely maintained.
People with certain disabilities are exempt from the order. People who are hard of hearing often use facial movements to relay their meaning or reading lips to understand others. Wearing a mask may interfere with their ability to communicate with—or understand—others. We must make sure everyone can communicate and remain safe.
Get tested for COVID-19 if you have participated in any large gatherings.




Masks show compassion.
Wearing a face covering shows you care about the people around you. Face coverings limit the transmission of droplets that could spread COVID-19.
Droplets spread when you talk, laugh, sneeze, or breathe. You could have the virus that causes COVID-19 and not know it. A face covering also offers protection from receiving droplets from others. So, wear a mask to protect your loved ones and your neighbors.
Keep it clean! Learn how to care for your face covering.
Want to make your own mask? Use these instructions. 
Public health order—and exemptions.
The order requires we wear a face covering in indoor public spaces, such as stores, restaurants or offices, or when outdoors and unable to maintain 6 feet of distance between people. Some counties may choose to adopt stricter policies.
Exemptions to the order include:

Children:
    
Under age 2 should never wear a face covering for safety reasons.
Ages 2-4 should wear a face covering in all public settings when an adult can supervise to make sure the child uses it safely.


Not required for people:
    
With a disability that makes it hard to wear or remove a face covering.
With difficulty breathing.
Who have medical advice that wearing a mask poses a health risk.
Who are hearing impaired and use facial expression and mouth movement to aid in their communication.
Communicating with someone who lipreads. In this case a person may temporarily remove their mask.
Who are eating or sleeping.
Who have safety concerns.



Resolved.
The Tacoma-Pierce County Board of Health adopted a resolution calling for the use of face coverings on June 17, 2020. Health Department officials continue to support that call for action. The City of Tacoma also passed a resolution on face coverings.
Need a mask?
Get masks at convenient locations around the county. Masks are available specifically for people with income 200% below Federal Poverty Level.

FAQs





            What should my childcare do to prevent spread of illness?
        



Employees should ensure they are fever and symptom free before they leave home and report to work.
Conduct daily health checks of children when they arrive.

Look for signs of illness and ask parents about the child’s health.
Take their temperature.
If they are coughing or have other significant respiratory symptoms, they should go home immediately.

Follow  strategies for schools and childcare as outlined in the CDC mitigation guidance. 






            What are quarantine and isolation?
        



Quarantine is the separation of a person possibly exposed to a disease but not yet sick to prevent the potential spread of disease to others.
Isolation is used to separate a currently ill person who can spread the disease to others.






            Are gatherings (childcare or elsewhere) safe for children with preexisting health conditions?
        



Currently all gatherings are banned under Governor Inslee's Stay home, stay safe order.  
Children at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19—like a compromised immune system or respiratory conditions like severe asthma—should stay home. When in doubt, consult the child’s doctor for guidance.






            Should custodians wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when they clean and sanitize?
        



            If custodians must continue work at schools, they should follow their school’s PPE policies when they clean and sanitize.
        





            Can I use hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?
        



            Handwashing is the preferred method to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren’t available . 
        





            Can children play on playground equipment or sports courts? 
        



            Groups of 5 or fewer children can use playground equipment. Please keep children from different households 6 feet apart, and make sure children wash their hands or use hand sanitizer after using playground equipment. Sports courts such as outdoor tennis can resume additional operations in phase 2 with some limitations. Check with your local parks department to see their plan for reopening.  
        





            How do I achieve physical distancing at my child care facility?
        



Groups shouldn't include more than 10 people. Keep 6 feet of distance between people.

Remove large group activities.
Limit the number of children in each program space.
Increase distance during table work.
Plan activities that don't require close physical contact between multiple children.
Limit item sharing. If children share items, remind them to not touch their face and to wash their hands.
Limit use of water/sensory tables. Wash hands immediately after use.
Minimize time standing in lines.
Incorporate extra time outside. Open windows frequently.
Adjust the HVAC system to allow for more fresh air.
Avoid gathering in larger groups. For outside time and lunch, gather in small groups or 10 or less.







            How do I clean toys at my child care facility?
        



            Clean toys and equipment more often. Clean with soap and water, then disinfect with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved disinfectant registered for use against the novel coronavirus. If toys aren't easy to clean (like stuffed animals, bean bag chairs, pillows, etc.), remove them temporarily. Some items can't be cleaned or sanitized (like play dough or slime). Stop using these items temporarily.
        





            How do I disinfect keyboards and other electronic devices that can't be sprayed?
        



            Use alcohol wipes to wipe down keyboards or other devices.
        





            I don’t have a primary care provider. Where can I find one?
        



            Check out our free or low-cost health resources to help you thrive. Only use the emergency department for emergency medical care.
        





            If our childcare facility decides to close, how long should we remain closed?
        



            Consider first why you would need to close. Currently we don't recommend that childcare centers close in Pierce County to support social distancing. Base decisions regarding closure on the circumstances at your facility. For example, if someone is sick with confirmed COVID 19, close contacts should stay home for 14 days after their contact. Depending how many people this involves, this may influence your decision for how long to close. Most individuals infected with COVID-19 begin to develop symptoms within 14 days. Anyone with symptoms should contact their healthcare provider.  






            Is it safe to bring my kids to the park?
        



We encourage you to enjoy the outdoors and playtime. If you visit a park, avoid playground equipment and other surfaces people touch often. Bring other games like balls and frisbees to play with. Practice social distancing. Keep at least 6 feet between people. Wash your hands often. If you don't have access to a sink, use hand sanitizer.






            What can I do to minimize the potential for germ spread in a childcare environment?
        



Follow these step to reduce the of spread germs:

Remove toys that aren't easy to clean like stuffed animals and pillows.
Rotate toys out. Clean and sanitize between rotations.
Provide space between children during play time and other gatherings.
Stagger time in playrooms and playground to reduce the number of children in one space.
Upon entry each day, take the child's temperature and check for symptoms. If you can't take their temperature, ask the caregiver to take the child's temperature and check for symptoms at home before they arrive. Then ask them to complete and sign a form reporting this information.
Remind families to stay home if they are unwell or have:
    
Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell.


Develop activities that encourage individual play like as reading, puzzles and coloring.
If you do family-style meals, have one staff member handle utensils and divide food.

People with COVID-19 reported a range of symptoms that can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure.






            What is the recommended group size for child care facilities?
        



            Reduce group sizes to no more than 22 people total, including children and adults. If it's not possible to separate groups by rooms, create a physical barrier (e.g. tables, cones, etc.) between groups to provide at least 6 feet of separation.
        





            What questions should I ask during a health screening at my child care facility?
        



Every day when children arrive, check for and ask if they have any of the following symptoms. If you observe symptoms, the child shouldn't attend child care. 

Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Or at least 2 of these symptoms:

Fever of 100.4 F or higher.
Chills.
Repeated shaking with chills.
Muscle pain.
Headache.
Sore throat.
New loss of taste or smell.

Use one of the recommended CDC screening methods to check temperatures. 






            What safety precautions should we take at school meal distribution sites?
        



            Read our recommendations for Safe Practices and Social Distancing at Emergency Feeding Locations.
        





            What should child care providers do if they are at higher risk of serious illness?
        



People at high risk for serious illness:

Age 65 or older.
Live in a care facility.
Have an underlying health condition, like heart or lung disease, diabetes or weekend immune system.

People with the above conditions shouldn't provide child care or visit child care facilities.

Small childcare centers or in-home providers should consider closing if the owner or operator is at high risk for serious illness and can't be excluded to remain operational. 






            Where can I find out information for child care?
        



            We've received a lot of questions about child care options. Visit our schools and childcare page to find answers to your questions.
        





            Where can I find resources for teaching children proper handwashing? 
        



            Visit our handwashing webpage to print fun activities and posters.

FAQs





            What are severe symptoms of COVID-19?
        



Severe symptoms may include, but are not limited to:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen.
Sudden dizziness.
Confusion.
Severe or persistent vomiting.
Flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough.

Seek medical care if you are concerned about the health and safety of yourself or your clients. If you are over age 65, have underlying medical problems like diabetes, heart disease or lung disease, or weakened/suppressed immune symptoms, you may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications.






            Can my clients access telehealth services for COVID-19?  
        




Yes, and you can help them! There may be different technology, insurance, and ID requirements depending on the option you choose.   
Does your client have Apple Health?
They cover telehealth services for COVID-19 when medically necessary. Find out more on the insurer’s website: Molina, Coordinated HealthCare, or AmeriGroup. 
Most plans also have 24/7 nursing lines. Questions? Contact customer service.  
Is your client uninsured?
MultiCare and Franciscan are offering Free virtual visits to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19. Both programs require an online account. If your client does not have an email address, you can help them set one up for free through a service like Gmail or Yahoo. If a client has no mailing address or phone number, enter your organization’s information.





Free MultiCare virtual visits to people with COVID-19 symptoms . Use promo code COVID19 to waive the regular $25 fee. Read other FAQs.


Free CHI Franciscan e-visits to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19. Use the discount code COVID19. Read the FAQs.  












            How can people living homeless get their stimulus payments?
        



People without taxable income (or whose income is too low to have to file) may need to file a tax return to qualify for the stimulus checks. People with Social Security income will not need to file. The IRS will use it to determine eligibility for stimulus checks. People who have Social Security income and children under 17 in their household, should still file to receive the additional $500 per child.
Find forms, check status and more at www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments.
Don’t have an address and need help? Contact Associated Ministries at (253) 426-1516 or AmyA@associatedministries.org.
 






            Is Assessment and Recovery different than Quarantine and Isolation?
        



We use the terms assessment and recovery instead of quarantine and isolation as they are less technical.
Assessment: People exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case. We assess people for signs or symptoms of the virus. They need to be alone for 14 days to reduce any potential spread of the disease.
Recovery: People who tested positive for the virus or have symptoms and are waiting for test results. They don’t need hospital care but must remain isolated from others and so the disease doesn’t spread.






            What is the difference between a Temporary Care Center and a Temporary Expansion Shelter?
        



A Temporary Care Center is a resource for people who can’t safely or practically stay at home when asked to by a public health professional. For example, a person living with an elderly or immune-compromised family member may need to be elsewhere temporarily for assessment and recovery to avoid getting the family member sick. A person living homeless may be placed in a temporary care center if that is the best option for them.
A Temporary Expansion Shelter is a resource for people living homeless to practice social distancing. Homeless shelters will work with public health and human resources to coordinate needs and placement in an expansion shelter. 






            Where can I find information about volunteering?
        



Many nonprofits need your help. Learn where you can safely volunteer. United Way of Pierce County has several volunteer opportunities. Visit their website to learn more or to recruit volunteers.

How to prepare for COVID-19 in your business
Businesses should plan how to decrease the spread COVID-19 during the pandemic. We recommended the following strategies.
Urge employees, particularly sick ones, to stay home.

Wear a cloth face covering. 
Employees with a fever or who show symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home.
Don't require a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick with acute respiratory illness to validate their illness.
Encourage all employees to protect themselves: 

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.



Download our Triage for Medical Need infographic, available in multiple languages:
English • Spanish • Chinese • Russian • Korean • Vietnamese • Tagalog


Implement physical distancing.

All employees should telework as much as possible.
Apply social distancing methods:
    
Offer flexible work hours. 
Stagger work schedules.
Avoid contact like handshakes or high-fives. Maintain 6 feet of separation.
Remove large work-related gatherings like conferences or staff meetings.
Meet via phone or electronically, rather than in-person.



Ensure your sick leave policies are up to date.

Understand Washington's paid sick leave law. 
Maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for themselves or a sick family member.
Review policies to ensure your sick leave policies and practices are  consistent with public health guidance.
Establish a process to communicate information to employees and business partners.


Prepare for increased absences.

Monitor and respond to absenteeism at the workplace. Implement plans to continue essential business functions in the event you experience high levels of absent employees.
Cross-train staff to perform essential functions so your business or government agency can operate even if key staff members are absent. 
Prepare to change your business practices if needed to maintain critical operations (e.g., identify alternative suppliers, prioritize customers, or temporarily suspend some of your operations if needed). 
Consider canceling non-essential business travel to other countries per CDC's travel guidance. 


Notify employees of a confirmed COVID-19 case.

If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, notify employees of their potential exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace. Make sure you maintain confidentiality, as required by the Americans with Disability Act.

FAQs





            What type of cleaning and disinfecting products should I use?
        



Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles) with regular household detergent and water. 
Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved products with emerging viral pathogens claims. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
Products will have the following claim:
This product demonstrates effectiveness against viruses like COVID-19 on hard non-porous surfaces. Therefore, this product can be used against COVID-19 when used in accordance with the directions for use against [name of supporting virus] on hard, non-porous surfaces.
Green products receive certification from a third party. Products will have a note on the label. DOH recommends green products but doesn’t require them.






            I don’t want to follow Governor Inslee’s proclamations. What happens if I don't follow the rules?
        



            Gov. Inslee declared a State of Emergency in Washington State. According to RCW 43.06.220 State of Emergency—Powers of governor pursuant to proclamation, any person who willfully violates any provisions of an order issued by the governor is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
        





            How can employers protect workers?
        



As much as possible, employers should encourage and support remote work. We encourage people to wash their hands often, cover mouth and nose when they cough and sneeze and stay home when they are sick. We recommend employers have sick leave available and policies in place. Check out more information for employers and businesses on the CDC's website.






             I work with infectious or medical waste. Should I take additional precautions? 
        



Workers and employers should manage waste contaminated with COVID-19 the same as they would with other regulated medical or infectious waste. Worker should follow standard practices and wear PPE required as part of their normal duties. 
For additional information consult the regulated medical waste information in CDC’s guidelines for environmental infection control in healthcare facilities. 






             My employer is creating an unsafe work environment by not providing or requiring face coverings be worn. What should I do?
        



            Talk to your employer directly. If you still believe your employer is not following the regulations, you may report them to Labor and Industry using the Alleged Safety or Health Hazards form.
        





            Can I go to my gym in Phase 2?
        



Only staffed gyms that provide appointment-only personal fitness training or fitness classes with 5 or fewer can open. Gyms may not reopen in a manner that allows members to workout with equipment on their own.






            Do I need to wear a mask at the gym or the grocery store?
        



Most people should wear a face covering in public. Wear a face covering in indoor public spaces except when you eat. You do not need to wear one when you exercise as long as you can maintain 6 feet of distance from others. It’s a good idea to keep a face covering with you and wear it if you come across other people. See our tips for face coverings.






            How do I social distance at my business or government agency (non-medical facility)?
        



Implement telework options for your staff. If staff can't work from home, follow these recommendations:

Increase physical distance between staff.
Allow flexible work hours or stagger shifts.
Remind employees they should not use other employee’s phones, desks, offices, equipment or other work tools.
Provide education and informational materials about worker health and safety, including proper hygiene practices.
Protect workers in close contact with a sick person by providing personal protective equipment (PPE).
Sick employees or employees with sick family members need to stay home.
Separate sick employees from other employees and send them home immediately.
Frequently clean commonly touched surfaces, using routine cleaning practices.

Find more guidance on these websites:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)







            I had COVID-19, when can I return to work?
        



If you tested positive for COVID-19, you need to remain under home isolation for 10 days and for 72 hours after fever is gone and symptoms are better. 






            I think my business is essential. How can my business be added to the state list of essential businesses? 
        




Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department doesn’t have the authority to make state-level designations of essential businesses under Governor Inslee’s order. 


Visit the State’s Essential Business page to see if your business category is included or to request an exemption.  







            I work in solid waste. Should I take additional precautions? 
        



Current OSHA and CDC guidance for COVID-19 exposure during solid waste management indicates the risk is low. COVID-19 transmits by droplets and waste is consolidated. 
Solid waste workers should use current required personal protective equipment (PPE) for protection.
We recommend the following steps when you handle bagged solid waste: 

Wear required PPE. 
Do not touch your face.
Wash your hands frequently or use alcohol-based sanitizer if handwashing is not available.
Do not come to work if you feel sick. 

 

 








            I work in wastewater. Should I take additional precautions? 
        



The CDC currently expects the risk of transmission of COVID-19 through sewage systems is low. Current disinfection in wastewater treatment facilities are sufficient.
Wastewater treatment plant workers should follow routine practices to prevent exposure to wastewater. Wastewater workers should use standard practices including basic hygiene precautions and recommended PPE for their current work tasks when they handle untreated waste.






            If field crews come in contact with a person who exhibits symptoms of COVID-19 should we be reporting these cases?
        



            Follow guidance from Washington State Department of Health: What to do if you were potentially exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19.
        





            Should I take additional precautions with COVID-19 waste? 
        



You don’t need to take special precautions with waste contaminated with COVID-19. Follow existing precautions to protect workers from the hazards during their routine solid waste and wastewater management job tasks. 
Learn more on OSHA and CDC websites.






            What if an employee tests positive for COVID-19?
        



Your employee generally needs to be in close contact with a sick person to get infected. Close contact includes:

Living in the same household as a sick person with COVID-19,
Caring for a sick person with COVID-19
Being within 6 feet of a sick person with COVID-19 for about 15 minutes, OR
Being in direct contact with secretions from a sick person with COVID-19 (e.g., being coughed on, kissing, sharing utensils, etc.)

See our video to learn more about what we mean by close contact. 
Each disease investigation is unique. When appropriate, the Health Department provides specific guidance to organizations, businesses, schools and government officials based on possible disease exposure risk.
We encourage as many people as possible to stay home if able. If you are a close contact of a confirmed case or are experiencing symptoms, ensure you can stay home.
All staff should:

Monitor themselves for symptoms.
 Practice physical distancing.
Stay home if they develop any symptoms.
Wash their hands.







            What if I can't pay my food establishment permit renewal or invoice on time?
        



We understand businesses in Pierce County are having a tough time right now.  
To aid food establishments open before the Coronavirus outbreak, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department deferred all financial penalties and permit suspensions on:

Unpaid food establishment permit renewals.
Other outstanding account balances. 

This allows for a longer grace period during the COVID-19 outbreak. We haven't identified end date for this deferment. We will communicate with food establishments in advance when we determine a date. 
Any facility going through plan review or anyone currently purchasing an establishment, must pay for their permit before they can operate.






            What is the Governor’s plan to restart construction projects?
        



            All construction is now allowed as of Phase 2. Construction projects must comply with physical distancing and health and safety requirements. Plan requirements include safety training, physical distancing, personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitation and cleanliness, monitoring employees for symptoms and logging job site visitors. Read more about COVID-19 Construction Job Site Requirements.

FAQs





            Should I worry about COVID-19 contamination on my food?
        



Food hasn't been identified as a likely source of COVID-19 spread at this time. However, food safety practices routinely performed at home and work can help reduce the spread of coronavirus and other respiratory viruses in our community.
When handling food use a barrier like tongs, gloves or other utensil to prevent direct hand contact with food. To help reduce illness wash, rinse, and sanitize tongs and other utensils in self-service areas often throughout the day.






            Can customers pay with cash?
        



Yes. You can choose the methods of payment you'll accept. To protect customers' and employees' health, we recommend you:

Encourage customers to pay electronically.
Ask customers to run their own card through the payment machine.
Consider using an automated ordering and payment system.
Consider using no-contact payment systems, like PayPal, Venmo or Zelle.







            Are there any additional requirements when I deliver food?
        




Your goal should be “no-contact delivery” to protect yourself and your customer.
Keep your car clean and sanitized.
Limit interaction with customers.
Remind customers to wash their hands before eating.







            If I run a hotel or bed and breakfast, can I serve a continental breakfast?
        



Yes, but only if it's room service or takeout.
If you normally serve buffet-style, you can serve pre-packaged, grab-and-go menu items. Post signs and markings on the floor to help customers stay 6 feet away from each other. Sanitize frequently between customers.






            I am a food employee. Do I need to take any special precautions when preparing food? 
        



Continue your regular safe food handling practices.

FAQs





            What type of cleaning and disinfecting products should I use?
        



Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles) with regular household detergent and water. 
Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved products with emerging viral pathogens claims. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
Products will have the following claim:
This product demonstrates effectiveness against viruses like COVID-19 on hard non-porous surfaces. Therefore, this product can be used against COVID-19 when used in accordance with the directions for use against [name of supporting virus] on hard, non-porous surfaces.
Green products receive certification from a third party. Products will have a note on the label. DOH recommends green products but doesn’t require them.






            How can I learn about Paid Family and Medical Leave?
        



You can use Paid Family and Medical Leave if you are sick with COVID-19 and off work for an extended time.






            How can people living homeless get their stimulus payments?
        



People without taxable income (or whose income is too low to have to file) may need to file a tax return to qualify for the stimulus checks. People with Social Security income will not need to file. The IRS will use it to determine eligibility for stimulus checks. People who have Social Security income and children under 17 in their household, should still file to receive the additional $500 per child.
Find forms, check status and more at www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments.
Don’t have an address and need help? Contact Associated Ministries at (253) 426-1516 or AmyA@associatedministries.org.
 






            How do I report an eviction?
        



Governor Inslee banned evictions under most circumstances. You can report an unlawful eviction.






            I don’t have a primary care provider. Where can I find one?
        



            Check out our free or low-cost health resources to help you thrive. Only use the emergency department for emergency medical care.
        





            What if I don't have access to the internet to receive COVID-19 information?
        



If you have access to a computer or smartphone:

Free wifi from Xfinity.
Free unlimited data for T-Mobile customers.
Free unlimited data for Sprint customers.

Our disease investigators help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Contact tracing is one of our most effective public health strategies. Whenever a disease outbreak happens—whether it’s measles, pertussis, tuberculosis or COVID-19—our disease investigation team gets to work to help prevent the spread.
We have a strong track record with this work and a knack for building relationships with people. They trust our guidance—and follow it—when we need them to take steps that keep others from getting sick.

Building a team to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Pierce County.
We’re looking for people to join our COVID-19 disease investigation team. We are expanding our workforce so we can keep our community healthy if we see an increase in COVID-19 cases.  
Our team consists of:

Case and Contact Investigators.
Facility Case and Contact Investigators (drop teams).
Administrative Support.
Lab Coordinators.



What does the team do?
Case and contact investigators interview people who have or might have COVID-19—and their close contacts. They find out when people were sick and where they went to learn who else might be infected. They get in touch with close contacts. They ask people to isolate or quarantine and connect them with a place to stay if they can’t do so safely in their homes.
Facility investigators help to control outbreaks of COVID-19 through education, testing and guidance. They work closely with places like:

Long-term care facilities.
Local businesses.
Schools.
Shelters.





Care coordinators help support people in isolation or quarantine. 
Lab coordinators work with local labs and testing locations to process tests. 
Administrative support and supervisors help the team with its fast-paced work. 
The investigation team is a dynamic group that adapts to the needs in Pierce County communities. 


What we need from team members 
You must be willing to work collaboratively and flexibly. You must show professionalism and value serving diverse groups of people as we work towards community healing from the COVID-19 pandemic. Some positions may require a clinical license or certificate or specialized skills. 
Our data shows COVID-19 affects Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, Latinx, African-Americans and Native Americans more than other groups. We especially seek bi-lingual qualified people who are part of these communities.
Apply now
If you are looking for temporary employment with the Health Department, apply through WorkSource. If you want to volunteer, apply with the Pierce County Medical Reserve Corps.

Work together to stay healthy during every phase.
As we move through the phases of Safe Start, we must work together to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is more important than ever that you:

Maintain physical distance of six feet from others when required.
    
Wear a face covering when in public spaces.


Practice good hygiene.
Stay home when you’re sick.

What Phase 2 means for you
People at higher-risk of poor health outcomes from COVID-19, such as those over 65, people with compromised immune systems, and those with underlying conditions should continue to stay home and stay healthy. Everyone’s health is different. You should talk with your health care provider if you have questions about your health.
Gov. Inslee eased restrictions on many activities for everyone else:
Recreation:

Enjoy outdoor recreation like camping biking, running, or trips to the beach if you maintain six feet of physical distance from people outside of your household.

Golf
Outdoor recreation
Pools and putt-putt golf
Sporting activities



Social gatherings:

Choose five friends or non-household members you would also like to see regularly. When you play, eat out, visit, or otherwise socialize, try to limit your close contacts to this group. You can reduce the risk of infection while enjoying more Phase 2 freedom.

Spiritual gatherings:

Up to 100 people can meet outside for faith-based gatherings. That number doesn’t include staff.
Limit indoor services to 200 people or 25% capacity, whichever is less.
Spiritual gatherings

FAQs





            Can children play on playground equipment or sports courts? 
        



            Groups of 5 or fewer children can use playground equipment. Please keep children from different households 6 feet apart, and make sure children wash their hands or use hand sanitizer after using playground equipment. Sports courts such as outdoor tennis can resume additional operations in phase 2 with some limitations. Check with your local parks department to see their plan for reopening.  
        





            How can I prepare to reopen my business?  
        



            Read through your industry specific guidance to see what recommendations you should follow. You may need to obtain PPE, develop safety plans, appoint a safety supervisor or provide trainings before you can reopen.  
        





            Is safe distancing still important at playgrounds? 
        




Continue to practice safe distancing for you and your children. Encourage them to play but to stay 6 feet away from other people. And try to avoid standing in groups. 







            My business isn’t listed on the phased approach chart, and I don’t see any guidance. Where can I find more information?  
        



            You can submit inquiries on the Washington State Coronavirus Response webpage to ask for more information.  
        





            Once Pierce County moves to the next phase, do I need approval from the health department to reopen my business?  
        



            No. You may reopen your business if your business is within the approved phase and the Governor’s Office has released industry specific guidance. 
        





            What parks are open? 
        




Different parks are run buy different municipalities. Please check agencies like Pierce County Parks and Metro Parks Tacoma to see if a park near you is open. 







            When can my business open?  
        



            Review the Safe Start Washington Phased Reopening County-By-County Plan and find out which phase applies to your business. You must wait until Pierce County enters that phase before your business can open. 
        





            Where can I find my industry specific guidance?  
        



            Visit the Governor’s website to find the complete list of guidance documents.

4 phases of reopening
We are in Phase 2. Find out what activities are authorized in phase 2.

 
Be sure to wait until the Governor’s office issues your industry-specific guidance and safety criteria before reopening. You must meet all requirements before resuming operations.
Consider this guidance for ways to achieve physical distancing, employee and visitor health, cleaning and sanitizing, and personal hygiene (including masks) in your reopening plans. Download our reopening toolkit.
Download our Reopening Guidance infographics, available in multiple languages:
English | Spanish | Korean | Vietnamese | Tagalog | Russian | Simplified Chinese 
Physical distancing
Throughout all phases of the Safe Start Washington Plan, workplaces and individuals need to continue practicing physical distancing. Use these tips to help you keep your employees, guests and customers safe: 
For businesses

Add markings on floors where customers may have to stand in line to indicate 6 feet. 
If activities are difficult to complete while observing physical distancing, add plexiglass barriers to protect visitors and employees. 
Limit the number of people allowed into the facility to make it easier to physical distance. 
Implement a reservation system to reduce crowds and text/call patrons when they can receive services. 
Identify areas where congestion may occur and help alleviate by having an employee monitor physical distancing. 
Consider reorganizing public spaces to support one-way traffic flow to reduce congestion points.
We want to ensure Pierce County businesses reopen while maintaining the health and safety of employees and the public. Use this template to create a safety plan for your business or organization.

For recreation
Facilities




Reconfigure fitness equipment to provide at least 6 feet of separation between machines. It may be necessary to remove some equipment from service. 
Limit the number of people allowed into the facility to make it easier to physical distance. Allow people to sign up for gym time to keep rush times less crowded. 
Consider placing a time limit on visits so more people can enjoy physical activity. 
Step up your cleaning and sanitizing schedule. Make supplies convenient. Post reminder signs. Assign staff to monitor that people sanitize equipment after using.

Teams and groups

Engage in recreational activities that allow for physical distancing. Opt for bike riding rather than tackle football to be able to maintain physical distancing. 
If possible, recreate outdoors instead of indoors to allow for adequate ventilation and fresh air. 
Watch sports from afar. Rather than having in person spectators, broadcast games to allow everyone to tune in from their homes. 

For gatherings

Get creative and find new ways to gather. Stay in cars if a group must meet and broadcast messages over the radio or a phone app. 
As in person gatherings are allowed in phasing, reconfigure seating. Group families together and provide 6 feet of separation between groups. In certain venues, you may need to close off every other row to allow for physical distancing. 
A good tip to ensure enough distance is provided between individuals: Have adults reach out their arms. If it looks like fingers could touch, they are too close! Increase the distance until touching would not be possible. 
If it is a ticketed event, sell tickets online beforehand and implement a system where tickets can be scanned without interaction. 

Download our Physical Distancing for Recreation and Gatherings infographic, available in multiple languages:
English | Spanish | Korean | Vietnamese | Tagalog | Russian | Simplified Chinese 
Employee and visitor health

Use appropriate PPE. Check guidance specific to your workplace and with Department of Labor & Industries. 
Create a COVID-19 safety plan. This plan should include topics such as PPE use, physical distancing, hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting, symptom monitoring, incident reporting and response procedures if your workplace has a positive case. 
Appoint a COVID-19 supervisor or safety officer for your workplace. The supervisor is responsible for monitoring the health of employees and enforcing the COVID-19 safety plan. 
Hold COVID-19 safety trainings. Before resuming work, hold a training for all employees on worksite policies, PPE use, proper physical distancing and COVID-19 prevention. 
Face coverings help prevent disease spread when people have COVID-19 but don’t yet have symptoms. Face coverings should be used when people cannot maintain six feet distance. They should also be used if people are six feet distant but share a small workspace with poor ventilation for a long period of time.
If you are the business owner, children over the age of 5 and adults who enter your business should wear face coverings. Face coverings are recommended for children age 2-4. Children under the age of 2 are not required to wear face coverings.
Post signage reminding employees, customers and guests to maintain physical distancing, wash hands frequently, wear masks if needed and disinfect regularly. 
Complete a health check of your employees and visitors. Ask if they have experienced any COVID-19 symptoms. 
Keep a visitor log. Record the name, contact information and time visited. Keep the log in case contact tracing is needed. 

Cleaning and sanitizing
Cleaning and disinfecting help control the spread of COVID-19. Follow these best practices to clean, disinfect, and help make it easier to keep your workplace safe: 


Increase the cleaning frequency of high touch items (doors, faucets, keypads, etc.).
Use an EPA-registered disinfectant. Pay attention to contact times (the time the surface must remain wet to kill the virus). Try to use products with shorter contact times if disinfecting an area that is in constant use. 
Broadcast a public message over the loudspeaker to remind employees, customers and guests to wash their hands, clean and disinfect their space, etc. Frequency of the message depends on visitor turnover. Retail establishments may need to provide this reminder every 15 minutes or half hour, for example. 
Take drinking fountains out of service to eliminate high touch points. Encourage employees, customers and guests to bring their own water bottles. Use only non-touch bottle fillers. 
Prop doors open to prevent people from touching additional surfaces. 
Provide hand sanitizer stations at entrances and encourage use. 
Provide hand sanitizer stations at the top and bottom of stairwells. Encourage people to use the handrails to prevent falls.
Encourage people to use their own pens or provide a pen that a customer can then keep. 
Increase ventilation in the building by opening windows or running the HVAC system at full capacity. 

Personal hygiene
Wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. When you get home from work or running errands, wash your hands. Wash your hands:

After touching a contaminated surface. 
Before preparing or eating food. 
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. 
Before and after touching your face. 
Before and after caring for someone who is sick. 
After using the restroom.

Wear a cloth mask to help protect others. If you are sick or asymptomatic but contagious, a mask will help prevent you from making others sick. Make sure the mask covers your nose and mouth.
Practice physical distancing. Stay 6 feet away from others and do not gather in groups. 
Stay home if you are sick! Everyone can do their part. 
Many businesses are opening their doors at certain times to allow those at higher risk of severe illness to shop or visit in ease. Consider running errands during these times if you feel unsafe. 
Remember you have control over your own health. If you do not feel safe or comfortable, you have the right to leave! As businesses begin to reopen, you get to choose if you want to visit.

Businesses and Government COVID-19 I work with infectious or medical waste. Should I take additional precautions? Workers and employers should manage waste contaminated with COVID-19 the same as they would with other regulated medical or infectious waste. Worker should follow standard practices and wear PPE required as part of their normal duties. 
For additional information consult the regulated medical waste information in CDC’s guidelines for environmental infection control in healthcare facilities.  My employer is creating an unsafe work environment by not providing or requiring face coverings be worn. What should I do?Talk to your employer directly. If you still believe your employer is not following the regulations, you may report them to Labor and Industry using the Alleged Safety or Health Hazards form.Can I go to my gym in Phase 2?Only staffed gyms that provide appointment-only personal fitness training or fitness classes with 5 or fewer can open. Gyms may not reopen in a manner that allows members to workout with equipment on their own.Do I need to wear a mask at the gym or the grocery store?Most people should wear a face covering in public. Wear a face covering in indoor public spaces except when you eat. You do not need to wear one when you exercise as long as you can maintain 6 feet of distance from others. It’s a good idea to keep a face covering with you and wear it if you come across other people. See our tips for face coverings.How can employers protect workers?As much as possible, employers should encourage and support remote work. We encourage people to wash their hands often, cover mouth and nose when they cough and sneeze and stay home when they are sick. We recommend employers have sick leave available and policies in place. Check out more information for employers and businesses on the CDC's website.How do I social distance at my business or government agency (non-medical facility)?Implement telework options for your staff. If staff can't work from home, follow these recommendations:

Increase physical distance between staff.
Allow flexible work hours or stagger shifts.
Remind employees they should not use other employee’s phones, desks, offices, equipment or other work tools.
Provide education and informational materials about worker health and safety, including proper hygiene practices.
Protect workers in close contact with a sick person by providing personal protective equipment (PPE).
Sick employees or employees with sick family members need to stay home.
Separate sick employees from other employees and send them home immediately.
Frequently clean commonly touched surfaces, using routine cleaning practices.

Find more guidance on these websites:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
I don’t want to follow Governor Inslee’s proclamations. What happens if I don't follow the rules?Gov. Inslee declared a State of Emergency in Washington State. According to RCW 43.06.220 State of Emergency—Powers of governor pursuant to proclamation, any person who willfully violates any provisions of an order issued by the governor is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.I had COVID-19, when can I return to work?If you tested positive for COVID-19, you need to remain under home isolation for 10 days and for 72 hours after fever is gone and symptoms are better. I think my business is essential. How can my business be added to the state list of essential businesses? 
Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department doesn’t have the authority to make state-level designations of essential businesses under Governor Inslee’s order. 


Visit the State’s Essential Business page to see if your business category is included or to request an exemption.  
I work in solid waste. Should I take additional precautions? Current OSHA and CDC guidance for COVID-19 exposure during solid waste management indicates the risk is low. COVID-19 transmits by droplets and waste is consolidated. 
Solid waste workers should use current required personal protective equipment (PPE) for protection.
We recommend the following steps when you handle bagged solid waste: 

Wear required PPE. 
Do not touch your face.
Wash your hands frequently or use alcohol-based sanitizer if handwashing is not available.
Do not come to work if you feel sick. 

 

 

I work in wastewater. Should I take additional precautions? The CDC currently expects the risk of transmission of COVID-19 through sewage systems is low. Current disinfection in wastewater treatment facilities are sufficient.
Wastewater treatment plant workers should follow routine practices to prevent exposure to wastewater. Wastewater workers should use standard practices including basic hygiene precautions and recommended PPE for their current work tasks when they handle untreated waste.If field crews come in contact with a person who exhibits symptoms of COVID-19 should we be reporting these cases?Follow guidance from Washington State Department of Health: What to do if you were potentially exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19.Should I take additional precautions with COVID-19 waste? You don’t need to take special precautions with waste contaminated with COVID-19. Follow existing precautions to protect workers from the hazards during their routine solid waste and wastewater management job tasks. 
Learn more on OSHA and CDC websites.What if an employee tests positive for COVID-19?Your employee generally needs to be in close contact with a sick person to get infected. Close contact includes:

Living in the same household as a sick person with COVID-19,
Caring for a sick person with COVID-19
Being within 6 feet of a sick person with COVID-19 for about 15 minutes, OR
Being in direct contact with secretions from a sick person with COVID-19 (e.g., being coughed on, kissing, sharing utensils, etc.)

See our video to learn more about what we mean by close contact. 
Each disease investigation is unique. When appropriate, the Health Department provides specific guidance to organizations, businesses, schools and government officials based on possible disease exposure risk.
We encourage as many people as possible to stay home if able. If you are a close contact of a confirmed case or are experiencing symptoms, ensure you can stay home.
All staff should:

Monitor themselves for symptoms.
 Practice physical distancing.
Stay home if they develop any symptoms.
Wash their hands.
What if I can't pay my food establishment permit renewal or invoice on time?We understand businesses in Pierce County are having a tough time right now.  
To aid food establishments open before the Coronavirus outbreak, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department deferred all financial penalties and permit suspensions on:

Unpaid food establishment permit renewals.
Other outstanding account balances. 

This allows for a longer grace period during the COVID-19 outbreak. We haven't identified end date for this deferment. We will communicate with food establishments in advance when we determine a date. 
Any facility going through plan review or anyone currently purchasing an establishment, must pay for their permit before they can operate.What is the Governor’s plan to restart construction projects?All construction is now allowed as of Phase 2. Construction projects must comply with physical distancing and health and safety requirements. Plan requirements include safety training, physical distancing, personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitation and cleanliness, monitoring employees for symptoms and logging job site visitors. Read more about COVID-19 Construction Job Site Requirements.What type of cleaning and disinfecting products should I use?Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles) with regular household detergent and water. 
Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved products with emerging viral pathogens claims. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
Products will have the following claim:
This product demonstrates effectiveness against viruses like COVID-19 on hard non-porous surfaces. Therefore, this product can be used against COVID-19 when used in accordance with the directions for use against [name of supporting virus] on hard, non-porous surfaces.
Green products receive certification from a third party. Products will have a note on the label. DOH recommends green products but doesn’t require them.Case Count Information COVID-19How can I view my geographic region on the map?Click the double-arrow on the top left corner of the map to open the legend. You can then select the layout you want to view including geographic reporting areas, case counts by census tract and long-term care facility locations.There aren’t many cases where I live. Am I less likely to get COVID-19?

COVID-19 has spread throughout Pierce County. The best way to protect yourself and your family is to stay home. To prevent the spread of COVID-19: 




Wash your hands with soap and warm for 20 seconds.


Avoid touching your face, mouth and eyes.

Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, like tables, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, mobile devices and keyboards. 


Avoid sharing personal items, like water bottles, eating utensils and towels.



What can I see on this map? This interactive map shows Pierce County census tracts—neighborhoods of about 2,500 to 8,000 people. Click on an area to see its number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.Where can I find information about hospital beds available in Pierce County? Or other hospitalization data?Hospitalization information changes daily. At present time, the health department reports only hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients (see hospitalizations tab on Safe Start dashboard). Based on information we get from area hospital systems, we report percent of licensed hospital beds occupied in the county. It is one of the metrics we monitor to determine when we may be eligible to advance to another phase of Washington’s Safe Start plan. As of mid-June, about 70% of licensed hospital beds were occupied.Why did you add this map? We added this map so you can see the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pierce County neighborhoods. Our goal is to share reliable information with the public and our partners.Why did you change this map?This map used to show geographic areas of at least 20,000 people. We received many requests for more detailed information. We changed the map to show confirmed COVID-19 cases by census tracts—neighborhoods of about 2,500 to 8,000 people.Why do our case numbers differ from what the Department of Health reports on its website? 
To give our residents the most up-to-date information available, we include case and death reports we receive directly from local healthcare providers and laboratories in our daily case counts. DOH has experienced delays in its reporting systems. 
Why do you no longer report cases for JBLM?The Department of Defense asked us to not publicly report numbers for Joint Base Lewis-McChord. The Pentagon said this information could be "a risk to operational security and could jeopardize operations." Read more in Stars and Stripes.Why isn’t my city listed in case counts?To protect patient privacy, we only report cases in geographical areas with populations greater than 20,000 people. Some cities are not included in the breakdown, as they may fall within the lesser population count.Why isn’t the case count web page loading?Sometimes certain parts of the page load slowly. Often, the problem relates to certain web browsers, such as Internet Explorer. Try a different web browser like Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Microsoft Edge.Exposure, Symptoms & Treatment COVID-19Can a person spread the infection if they don’t feel sick?People who are infected can spread COVID-19 before they show symptoms. Right now, researchers believe patients are most contagious when they are sickest. We review new reports and guidance from the CDC as they become available and will evaluate any changes needed to our response. Can I get COVID-19 from a surface or object?We are learning that COVID-19 lives on surfaces for varied periods of time depending on the material. 
Make sure to wash your hands frequently when in public places. See our guidance for how to clean and disinfect for COVID-19. Can I get COVID-19 from my pet?We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals. However, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people appears low. Treat pets like you would family members. Don't let pets interact with people outside your home. Isolate sick people from everyone else, including pets. Learn more information from the CDC.How does COVID-19 spread?COVID-19 can spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks near others, or through close personal contact like shaking hands. You can also get it when you touch something that has the virus on it, then touch your mouth, nose or eyes before you wash your hands. The virus can spread before people show symptoms.I had COVID-19, when can I return to work?If you tested positive for COVID-19, you need to remain under home isolation for 10 days and for 72 hours after fever is gone and symptoms are better. I think I have COVID-19. What should I do?View our infographic. Talk to your healthcare provider. He or she will be able to determine if you should be tested.  If you suspect you have COVID-19 follow these steps to prevent the spread of disease:


Stay home except to get medical care.


People who have mild cases of COVID-19 can isolate at home during their illness. Restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Don’t go to work, school, or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.


Separate yourself from other people in your home. 


Stay in a specific room and away from other people and animals in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available.
Monitor your symptoms.
Seek prompt medical attention if your illness get worse. COVID-19 symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure:


Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell.


Call ahead before you visit your doctor or an emergency room.
If you have a medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider take steps to prevent exposure to other people.I was around someone who has COVID-19. What should I do?You should monitor your health for fever, cough and shortness of breath during the 14 days after the last day you were in close contact with the sick person with COVID-19. You should not go to work or school, and should avoid public places for 14 days.  I was in close contact with someone who was in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. What should I do?You have not been in contact with anyone known to be sick with COVID-19 within the last 14 days. Quarantine isn't necessary. Monitor your symptoms and stay home if you get sick.If I get exposed to COVID-19 or if I get it, am I immune now?Unfortunately, no. If you believe you were exposed and you didn’t get sick, you were lucky, not immune. Even if you were unlucky and got sick from COVID-19, you may still be able to get it again later.I'm a patient at a hospital. Am I at risk for COVID-19 from other patients?We recommend people with suspected COVID-19 cases be in their own room in a health care setting. Health care workers are trained to remove their personal protective equipment and wash their hands after seeing a patient, so the infection doesn’t leave the room. Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?Currently, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 or other coronaviruses. NIH scientists are actively working to develop a vaccine. Should I worry about COVID-19 contamination on my food?Food hasn't been identified as a likely source of COVID-19 spread at this time. However, food safety practices routinely performed at home and work can help reduce the spread of coronavirus and other respiratory viruses in our community.
When handling food use a barrier like tongs, gloves or other utensil to prevent direct hand contact with food. To help reduce illness wash, rinse, and sanitize tongs and other utensils in self-service areas often throughout the day.Should I worry about COVID-19 on my mail and packages?We are learning that COVID-19 lives on surfaces for varied periods of time depending on the material. 
Make sure to wash your hands frequently. See our guidance for how to clean and disinfect for COVID-19. What are COVID-19 symptoms?People with COVID-19 reported a range of symptoms that can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure:

Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell.
What is self-monitoring and active-monitoring?Self-monitoring: A person monitors themselves for symptoms, including fever, and reports any symptoms to their local public health department. Public health checks in periodically during the monitoring period. 
Active-monitoring: The local public health department contacts a person daily to monitor for symptoms, including fever, throughout the monitoring period.What should I consider a fever?A fever is over 100.4 degrees F. If you have a fever, stay home and away from people.Where would People Under Investigation (PUIs) be while they wait for results of their tests? If we have People Under Investigation in Pierce County, they would wait for test results at home, if their medical condition allows. They should stay in a separate bedroom, ideally with a private bathroom, away from housemates. They should closely monitor symptoms to make sure their condition is stable. PUIs and other household members should take protective measures described in CDC guidance.  Will the flu shot help to prevent COVID-19?The flu vaccine is designed to prevent infections with influenza viruses, which are very different than coronaviruses. Likewise vaccinations against pneumonia are effective only on specific bacteria that cause certain types of pneumonia. They will not have a direct effect on coronavirus. 
But getting your flu and pneumonia vaccines help prevent people from getting sick, which can free up healthcare resources to respond to the pandemic. Getting recommended vaccinations might make it easier for a clinician to diagnose COVID-19 and make it less likely you could develop a problematic co-infection with another bug like flu and coronavirus. Food Establishments COVID-19Are there any additional requirements when I deliver food?
Your goal should be “no-contact delivery” to protect yourself and your customer.
Keep your car clean and sanitized.
Limit interaction with customers.
Remind customers to wash their hands before eating.
Can customers pay with cash?Yes. You can choose the methods of payment you'll accept. To protect customers' and employees' health, we recommend you:

Learn more about Food Worker and Establishment Guidance on COVID-19.If I run a hotel or bed and breakfast, can I serve a continental breakfast?Yes, but only if it's room service or takeout.
If you normally serve buffet-style, you can serve pre-packaged, grab-and-go menu items. Post signs and markings on the floor to help customers stay 6 feet away from each other. Sanitize frequently between customers.Should I worry about COVID-19 contamination on my food?Food hasn't been identified as a likely source of COVID-19 spread at this time. However, food safety practices routinely performed at home and work can help reduce the spread of coronavirus and other respiratory viruses in our community.

In addition, the normal donor screening process includes evaluation of your temperature, current health, and travel history. 
Donating blood saves lives. All types of blood are needed for cancer treatment, trauma cases, and many other situations. The process only takes an hour and actual donation time is about 10 minutes.What businesses and activities are allowed?More businesses and activities will open up as we go through the phases of Safe Start. Visit our Safe Start page to see which phase we are in and what activities are allowed.What is COVID-19?COVID-19 is a new respiratory virus with no vaccine or treatment. Most people will recover on their own, but some people can develop pneumonia and require medical care or hospitalization. COVID-19 transmission is widespread in our region. 
COVID-19 is not connected to race, ethnicity or nationality. Stigma will not help to fight the illness. Misinformation can spread faster than diseases. Do your part to prevent this. Seek—and share—accurate information.What type of cleaning and disinfecting products should I use?Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles) with regular household detergent and water. 
Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved products with emerging viral pathogens claims. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.

How can people living homeless get their stimulus payments?People without taxable income (or whose income is too low to have to file) may need to file a tax return to qualify for the stimulus checks. People with Social Security income will not need to file. The IRS will use it to determine eligibility for stimulus checks. People who have Social Security income and children under 17 in their household, should still file to receive the additional $500 per child.
Find forms, check status and more at www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments.
Don’t have an address and need help? Contact Associated Ministries at (253) 426-1516 or AmyA@associatedministries.org.
 Is Assessment and Recovery different than Quarantine and Isolation?We use the terms assessment and recovery instead of quarantine and isolation as they are less technical.
Assessment: People exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case. We assess people for signs or symptoms of the virus. They need to be alone for 14 days to reduce any potential spread of the disease.
Recovery: People who tested positive for the virus or have symptoms and are waiting for test results. They don’t need hospital care but must remain isolated from others and so the disease doesn’t spread.What are severe symptoms of COVID-19?Severe symptoms may include, but are not limited to:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen.
Sudden dizziness.
Confusion.
Severe or persistent vomiting.
Flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough.

Seek medical care if you are concerned about the health and safety of yourself or your clients. If you are over age 65, have underlying medical problems like diabetes, heart disease or lung disease, or weakened/suppressed immune symptoms, you may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications.What is the difference between a Temporary Care Center and a Temporary Expansion Shelter?A Temporary Care Center is a resource for people who can’t safely or practically stay at home when asked to by a public health professional. For example, a person living with an elderly or immune-compromised family member may need to be elsewhere temporarily for assessment and recovery to avoid getting the family member sick. A person living homeless may be placed in a temporary care center if that is the best option for them.
A Temporary Expansion Shelter is a resource for people living homeless to practice social distancing. Homeless shelters will work with public health and human resources to coordinate needs and placement in an expansion shelter. Where can I find information about volunteering?Many nonprofits need your help. Learn where you can safely volunteer. United Way of Pierce County has several volunteer opportunities. Visit their website to learn more or to recruit volunteers. Investigation and Contact Tracing COVID-19Do you tell close contacts who exposed them to COVID-19? No. When interviewers call close contacts, they don’t tell them who tested positive for COVID-19.How can I apply to be a contact tracer?Thank you for your interest in working with Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department. We are assessing what our needs will be for contact tracing. 
You can apply to join the team as a contract employee or volunteer.What information do you send close contacts? Every person receives guidance about how to keep themselves and other people safe. Interviewers can also help connect people with resources they may need while they quarantine for 14 days if they are not sick or isolate at home until they fully recover.What is a case investigation? When public health learns about a positive COVID-19 case, an interviewer contacts the person to investigate. What is contact tracing? Interviewers work with a person who tests positive for COVID-19 to determine their close contacts –anyone who was within 6 feet of them for 15 minutes or more while they were infectious. Interviewers then contact people who were close contacts to let them know they may have been exposed to COVID-19.What questions does the interviewer ask? Interviewers asks pre-approved questions for case investigations and contact tracing. They ask the person for their date of birth, address, gender at birth, race, ethnicity, and other questions. Interviewers don’t ask for information like immigration status, Social Security number, financial information, or marital status.Who do they share my information with?  Only public health agencies use the information they collect during the interview. We keep all personal information confidential.Masks COVID-19 I see a business may not be enforcing the order to wear face coverings. What should I do?You can choose to patronize another business. You can also report a suspected violation of a business or organization not following the Safe Start plan to the Governor’s Office. My employer is creating an unsafe work environment by not providing or requiring face coverings be worn. What should I do?Talk to your employer directly. If you still believe your employer is not following the regulations, you may report them to Labor and Industry using the Alleged Safety or Health Hazards form.Can facilities prohibit me from entry if I do not have a face covering?Yes. Some businesses can set requirements for entry to protect their customers and employees. Do I need a doctor’s note if I have a medical condition preventing me from wearing a face covering?If a medical, legal, or behavioral health specialist told you to not wear face coverings, you do not need to carry a doctor’s note.Do I need to wear a mask at the gym or the grocery store?Most people should wear a face covering in public. Wear a face covering in indoor public spaces except when you eat. You do not need to wear one when you exercise as long as you can maintain 6 feet of distance from others. It’s a good idea to keep a face covering with you and wear it if you come across other people. See our tips for face coverings.Do I need to wear a mask outside? 
If you are going to be around other people outdoors and can’t maintain physical distancing from other people, you should wear a mask. It’s a good idea to always keep a mask with you. 
Do I still have to wear a mask? 
It’s important for all of us to follow current Phase 2 guidance and stay focused on reducing the risk of spreading the disease in our community. More people are out and about in Phase 2, and it’s important to wear a cloth face covering that covers your nose and mouth when you can’t reasonably stay six feet or more away from others.
Does COVID-19 spread more easily indoors?The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads in droplets in the breath, sneezes, laughs, and coughs of infected people. The virus spreads more easily in poor ventilation and with limited access to fresh air. In outdoor settings, more fresh air circulates and people have more space to physically distance from others. Indoors, there is less air circulation in confined spaces making transmission of the virus easier.How do I report a private group not following the mask requirement?If the report is about a private group not following the proclamation, contact your local law enforcement agency. DO NOT call 911. Refer to the law enforcement agency website for directions on how to file a complaint or use the agency’s non-emergency number.How do we know cloth face coverings work?Researchers reviewed the scientific literature looking at the effectiveness of surgical masks and cloth face coverings. They found that the masks and cloth face coverings were effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19 — if we wear them! The biggest limitation to their effectiveness was inconsistent mask use.I find wearing a mask irritates my skin.  What should I do?You could get a skin irritation or rash while wearing a mask. Keep your face covering clean and dry; wash it every day.  Keep your face clean and well moisturized. If you find a face covering irritating, consider whether you may react to the soap you use to wash it or the type of fabric. To prevent skin irritations or acne, you might avoid wearing makeup under your mask. Switch to a different face covering if the one you wear gets damp.I see somebody not wearing a face covering in public. What should I do?  Nothing. People with certain medical conditions or other circumstances are exempt from the requirement to wear a face covering.  Be sure to wear your face covering and stay 6 feet away.I would rather just cover my mouth.  Does that help? In a word, no. COVID-19 spreads through droplets. Droplets come out of our nose when we breathe. To be effective, a mask must cover both the nose and mouth. If I’m healthy, do I still need to wear a mask? Yes. You can have COVID-19 and still feel fine, healthy, or normal. Infected people who do not experience symptoms still can spread the disease. Wear a mask to protect your friends and neighbors. Is physical distancing still required if I’m wearing a mask?Yes. We wear cloth face coverings to help us keep our breath, and the potentially infections droplets it contains, to ourselves. Face coverings are just one way to do that. They work best if you also stand 6 feet away from other people. Physical distancing, hand washing, staying home if sick, and getting tested for COVID-19—even if you have mild symptoms—are all important to do, even if you cover your face.Should I wear a mask?A Washington State order requires everyone to wear a face covering when you:

Are in indoor public spaces like stores, offices, businesses or restaurants.
Can't stay 6 feet or more apart outdoors.

 A mask or face covering is an extra layer of protection and isn’t a substitute for physical distance or handwashing. We recommend you save N95 or other medical-grade masks intended for healthcare workers.What are the health risks of wearing a face covering? Most people don't experience health risks when wearing a cloth face covering. Those who are younger than the age of two, those with certain medical conditions, and those who are not able to remove the face covering on their own should not wear one. The prolonged use of face coverings can be uncomfortable but wearing face coverings does not lead to CO2 intoxication or oxygen deficiency.What is the Health Department policy about face coverings for employees and customers? On May 18, we established a Face Covering Policy and Procedure for employees, volunteers and visitors to Health Department buildings.  
Staff are expected to wear face coverings in:


Common areas.
Work areas if you cannot ensure 6 feet of physical distance and will be in the work area for 15 minutes or longer.

We will continue to provide face coverings for staff and visitors when we reopen in-person services. Staff and visitors can wear their own coverings if they have them.
This aligns with Gov. Inslee’s announcement of new health and safety requirements for businesses under the state’s Safe Start Recovery Plan.
The state now requires people in Washington wear face coverings in public spaces. What is the state’s requirement about face coverings? As of June 26, a Washington State order requires everyone to wear a face covering when you:

Are in indoor public spaces like stores, offices, businesses or restaurants.
Can't stay 6 feet or more apart outdoors.
Where do I need to wear a mask? People should wear a mask when they are in public areas, especially when they can’t easily remain 6 feet or more away from others. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies. Face coverings aren’t a substitute for physical distancing. And you still need to practice healthy habits like: 

Wash your hands often with soap and warm water. 
Stay home when you're sick.
Cover your cough and sneezes with a tissue or elbow. 

 
 
 Who should wear a mask? 
 Everyone must wear a mask when they are in a public area and can’t safely physical distance. Don’t wear a mask if you:



Have trouble breathing.
Can't remove the mask without assistance.
Are under age 2.
Need to talk with someone who relies on facial movements or reading lips to understand or communicate. 

Children 2-4 are encouraged to wear face coverings with adult supervision.
 





 
Will wearing a mask make me sick?Cloth face coverings are meant to keep your germs to yourself. They let in plenty of oxygen when worn properly. Switch to a different face covering if you find the one you use hard to breathe through. If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, or have trouble breathing, sit down and remove your face covering. If it continues, call 911.Phase 3 COVID-19Early in the pandemic, Washington saw many positive tests at long-term care facilities like nursing homes and memory care centers. Are those trouble spots again? We are not seeing large numbers of cases from our ongoing testing in long term care and other care settings. For example, we tested clients and staff at a large homeless shelter in early June and all were negative.How bad is an increased case count? The daily count alone doesn’t tell the whole story. We are testing more which is good, it helps us know where disease is and where it isn’t.  We also know the weekly total hospital stays for COVID-19 patients is the lowest it’s been since mid-March when we started feeling the brunt of the outbreak. Still, the rising case count is a reminder that disease is present throughout our community and we must continue to maintain distance from others, wear face coverings, and keep up hygiene practices. Many variables go into deciding what action the Health Department needs to take. When will we be ready to apply for Phase 3? We look at our overall rate of cases, weekly hospitalizations, and other factors to determine when we will be ready to apply for Phase 3. We have increased our testing capacity and contact tracing staff, which are two other essential elements of Phase 3 readiness. Health Department Director Dr. Anthony Chen will recommend applying for Phase 3 when the case data and counter COVID-19 efforts align with the state’s expectations. We published a blog on June 19, “When will we be ready for Phase 3?” Read it for more information. Where do recent increased case counts come from?COVID-19 continues to be widespread in Pierce County, and we are not yet seeing any specific source for the uptick in cases over the past several days. We are watching this closely, but it’s still too soon to identify with certainty the cause of these increases. We need to study the data before we can be sure of the cause of an increase.  Why have there been changes recently in data reports?As we learn about this disease, the information we receive and share improves and helps us to better fight COVID-19. We aim to provide the most accurate and complete data we can as soon as we can to help inform the community. Beginning June 24, we will track and report overall local negative tests in our new Safe Start dashboard. This number will not include serology tests. Why is the case count going up now?More people are out and about in Phase 2, and it’s important to wear a cloth face covering over your nose and mouth when you can’t reasonably stay six feet or more away from others. COVID spreads when people encounter infected people, so any close contact where droplets could spread, even from a person without symptoms, can spread COVID.Will increased case counts keep us from going into Phase 3?The state set a goal of no more than 25 cases per 100,000 residents over 14 consecutive days. This is one of many metrics that will help the Health Director decide if it’s time to apply for Phase 3 of the state Safe Start Washington plan. We report this rate on our COVID-19 in Pierce County website, which is updated daily. We published a blog on June 19, “When will we be ready for Phase 3?” Read it for more information.Reopening COVID-19Can children play on playground equipment or sports courts? Groups of 5 or fewer children can use playground equipment. Please keep children from different households 6 feet apart, and make sure children wash their hands or use hand sanitizer after using playground equipment. Sports courts such as outdoor tennis can resume additional operations in phase 2 with some limitations. Check with your local parks department to see their plan for reopening.  How can I prepare to reopen my business?  Read through your industry specific guidance to see what recommendations you should follow. You may need to obtain PPE, develop safety plans, appoint a safety supervisor or provide trainings before you can reopen.  Is safe distancing still important at playgrounds? 
Continue to practice safe distancing for you and your children. Encourage them to play but to stay 6 feet away from other people. And try to avoid standing in groups. 
My business isn’t listed on the phased approach chart, and I don’t see any guidance. Where can I find more information?  You can submit inquiries on the Washington State Coronavirus Response webpage to ask for more information.  Once Pierce County moves to the next phase, do I need approval from the health department to reopen my business?  No. You may reopen your business if your business is within the approved phase and the Governor’s Office has released industry specific guidance. What parks are open? 
Different parks are run buy different municipalities. Please check agencies like Pierce County Parks and Metro Parks Tacoma to see if a park near you is open. 
When can my business open?  Review the Safe Start Washington Phased Reopening County-By-County Plan and find out which phase applies to your business. You must wait until Pierce County enters that phase before your business can open. Where can I find my industry specific guidance?  Visit the Governor’s website to find the complete list of guidance documents. Resources for Individuals and Families COVID-19How can I learn about Paid Family and Medical Leave?You can use Paid Family and Medical Leave if you are sick with COVID-19 and off work for an extended time.How can people living homeless get their stimulus payments?People without taxable income (or whose income is too low to have to file) may need to file a tax return to qualify for the stimulus checks. People with Social Security income will not need to file. The IRS will use it to determine eligibility for stimulus checks. People who have Social Security income and children under 17 in their household, should still file to receive the additional $500 per child.
Find forms, check status and more at www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments.

Free unlimited data for T-Mobile customers.
Free unlimited data for Sprint customers. 

If you don't have access to a computer or smartphone, call (855) 722-5378 to get up-to-date COVID-19 information.What type of cleaning and disinfecting products should I use?Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles) with regular household detergent and water. 
Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved products with emerging viral pathogens claims. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.
Products will have the following claim:
This product demonstrates effectiveness against viruses like COVID-19 on hard non-porous surfaces. Therefore, this product can be used against COVID-19 when used in accordance with the directions for use against [name of supporting virus] on hard, non-porous surfaces.
Green products receive certification from a third party. Products will have a note on the label. DOH recommends green products but doesn’t require them.Schools and Childcare COVID-19Are gatherings (childcare or elsewhere) safe for children with preexisting health conditions?Currently all gatherings are banned under Governor Inslee's Stay home, stay safe order.  
Children at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19—like a compromised immune system or respiratory conditions like severe asthma—should stay home. When in doubt, consult the child’s doctor for guidance.Can children play on playground equipment or sports courts? Groups of 5 or fewer children can use playground equipment. Please keep children from different households 6 feet apart, and make sure children wash their hands or use hand sanitizer after using playground equipment. Sports courts such as outdoor tennis can resume additional operations in phase 2 with some limitations. Check with your local parks department to see their plan for reopening.  Can I use hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?Handwashing is the preferred method to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren’t available . How do I achieve physical distancing at my child care facility?Groups shouldn't include more than 10 people. Keep 6 feet of distance between people.

Remove large group activities.
Limit the number of children in each program space.
Increase distance during table work.
Plan activities that don't require close physical contact between multiple children.
Limit item sharing. If children share items, remind them to not touch their face and to wash their hands.
Limit use of water/sensory tables. Wash hands immediately after use.
Minimize time standing in lines.
Incorporate extra time outside. Open windows frequently.
Adjust the HVAC system to allow for more fresh air.
Avoid gathering in larger groups. For outside time and lunch, gather in small groups or 10 or less.
How do I clean toys at my child care facility?Clean toys and equipment more often. Clean with soap and water, then disinfect with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved disinfectant registered for use against the novel coronavirus. If toys aren't easy to clean (like stuffed animals, bean bag chairs, pillows, etc.), remove them temporarily. Some items can't be cleaned or sanitized (like play dough or slime). Stop using these items temporarily.How do I disinfect keyboards and other electronic devices that can't be sprayed?Use alcohol wipes to wipe down keyboards or other devices.I don’t have a primary care provider. Where can I find one?Check out our free or low-cost health resources to help you thrive. Only use the emergency department for emergency medical care.If our childcare facility decides to close, how long should we remain closed?Consider first why you would need to close. Currently we don't recommend that childcare centers close in Pierce County to support social distancing. Base decisions regarding closure on the circumstances at your facility. For example, if someone is sick with confirmed COVID 19, close contacts should stay home for 14 days after their contact. Depending how many people this involves, this may influence your decision for how long to close. Most individuals infected with COVID-19 begin to develop symptoms within 14 days. Anyone with symptoms should contact their healthcare provider.  Is it safe to bring my kids to the park?We encourage you to enjoy the outdoors and playtime. If you visit a park, avoid playground equipment and other surfaces people touch often. Bring other games like balls and frisbees to play with. Practice social distancing. Keep at least 6 feet between people. Wash your hands often. If you don't have access to a sink, use hand sanitizer.Should custodians wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when they clean and sanitize?If custodians must continue work at schools, they should follow their school’s PPE policies when they clean and sanitize.What are quarantine and isolation?Quarantine is the separation of a person possibly exposed to a disease but not yet sick to prevent the potential spread of disease to others.
Isolation is used to separate a currently ill person who can spread the disease to others.What can I do to minimize the potential for germ spread in a childcare environment?Follow these step to reduce the of spread germs:

Remove toys that aren't easy to clean like stuffed animals and pillows.
Rotate toys out. Clean and sanitize between rotations.
Provide space between children during play time and other gatherings.
Stagger time in playrooms and playground to reduce the number of children in one space.
Upon entry each day, take the child's temperature and check for symptoms. If you can't take their temperature, ask the caregiver to take the child's temperature and check for symptoms at home before they arrive. Then ask them to complete and sign a form reporting this information.
Remind families to stay home if they are unwell or have:
    
Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell.


Develop activities that encourage individual play like as reading, puzzles and coloring.
If you do family-style meals, have one staff member handle utensils and divide food.

People with COVID-19 reported a range of symptoms that can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure.What is the recommended group size for child care facilities?Reduce group sizes to no more than 22 people total, including children and adults. If it's not possible to separate groups by rooms, create a physical barrier (e.g. tables, cones, etc.) between groups to provide at least 6 feet of separation.What questions should I ask during a health screening at my child care facility?Every day when children arrive, check for and ask if they have any of the following symptoms. If you observe symptoms, the child shouldn't attend child care. 

Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Or at least 2 of these symptoms:

Fever of 100.4 F or higher.
Chills.
Repeated shaking with chills.
Muscle pain.
Headache.
Sore throat.
New loss of taste or smell.

Use one of the recommended CDC screening methods to check temperatures. What safety precautions should we take at school meal distribution sites?Read our recommendations for Safe Practices and Social Distancing at Emergency Feeding Locations.What should child care providers do if they are at higher risk of serious illness?People at high risk for serious illness:

Age 65 or older.
Live in a care facility.
Have an underlying health condition, like heart or lung disease, diabetes or weekend immune system.

People with the above conditions shouldn't provide child care or visit child care facilities.

Small childcare centers or in-home providers should consider closing if the owner or operator is at high risk for serious illness and can't be excluded to remain operational. What should my childcare do to prevent spread of illness?Employees should ensure they are fever and symptom free before they leave home and report to work.
Conduct daily health checks of children when they arrive.

Look for signs of illness and ask parents about the child’s health.
Take their temperature.
If they are coughing or have other significant respiratory symptoms, they should go home immediately.

Follow  strategies for schools and childcare as outlined in the CDC mitigation guidance. Where can I find out information for child care?We've received a lot of questions about child care options. Visit our schools and childcare page to find answers to your questions.Where can I find resources for teaching children proper handwashing? Visit our handwashing webpage to print fun activities and posters.Temporary Care Centers COVID-19Can I bring my pet with me?We don’t allow pets at the temporary care centers. We have a designated Pet Care Center for your pets. We will transfer pets to an offsite center to feed and care for pets including overnight security. Can I have visitors?To protect everyone's health, we can’t allow visitors. Digital communication like video calls and hand-written note or cards are great ways to stay connected.Can someone leave a temporary care center against public health advice?Temporary care centers are available to provide a safe and supported alternative for residents. Staying at the center is voluntary. However, we will not allow people to come and go. To reduce COVID-19 spread, nursing staff will work with guests to resolve issues and strongly encourage them to stay until their assessment or recovery period is complete.

Protocols are in place in the event a person leaves against public health advice. How are people living near a temporary care center protected?Temporary care centers are effective and essential to slow disease spread and save lives. It is important for people who are sick with or exposed to COVID-19 to stay away from others. 
Our plans address local concerns:

24/7 security personnel.
Not allowing residents to come and go. We expect residents to stay in their rooms.
Social distancing for everyone on site.
Follow recommended daily sanitation procedures.
Not allowing visitors.
Cleaning or throwing away residents clothing before they leave.
Health Department referrals to the center and clearance before checkout.
Checkout process with screening.
Notification to South Sound 911, the Health Department and Pierce Transit about a person leaving against public health advice.
Deep cleaning by a professional company between room occupants.
How did you select temporary care center locations?Siting these services is not a decision that we take lightly. Many people stepped forward to offer their facilities. The Department of Emergency Management reviewed more than 80 sites countywide. Only a handful of potential sites can meet all the criteria. Site selection criteria includes:

Immediate availability.
Owner willingness to provide this service.
Security and access to emergency services.
Bathing, toilet and laundry facilities.
Food options.
Accessibility for people with disabilities. 
How do I get placed at a temporary care center?During the disease investigation process, the Health Department will identify eligible people who can't safely or practically stay at home. The Health Department will screen these people for temporary care center placement.How long will the hotel remain a care center?The temporary care center doesn't have an end date for operations. We review the contract every 30 days. The center will remain open to serve Pierce County residents as long as people need a place to safely isolate and quarantine. Is Assessment and Recovery different than Quarantine and Isolation?We use the terms assessment and recovery instead of quarantine and isolation as they are less technical.
Assessment: People exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case. We assess people for signs or symptoms of the virus. They need to be alone for 14 days to reduce any potential spread of the disease.
Recovery: People who tested positive for the virus or have symptoms and are waiting for test results. They don’t need hospital care but must remain isolated from others and so the disease doesn’t spread.Is there parking available?Unfortunately, there is no resident parking. A transportation team will bring people to the site and transport them out.Is there security at these centers? Initially, 24-hour uniformed law enforcement will be at the center to assess security needs. Uniformed contract security will be on site 24/7.What accommodations will you provide? Our goal is to provide accommodations for language, disability, and other factors to ensure residents have fair, equitable access to services. This may include interpretation by phone and ADA compliant rooms.What amenities will you offer?We will provide the following amenities at the temporary care center:

24/7 security.
Onsite laundry and biohazard cleaning.
Three meals a day.
Basic over-the-counter medication.
Access to Wi-Fi, TV, landline telephones, streamed religious services, and reading materials. (Some locations might not have TV.)
Interpretation and other resources for people who don’t speak English.
What is the difference between a Temporary Care Center and a Temporary Expansion Shelter?A Temporary Care Center is a resource for people who can’t safely or practically stay at home when asked to by a public health professional. For example, a person living with an elderly or immune-compromised family member may need to be elsewhere temporarily for assessment and recovery to avoid getting the family member sick. A person living homeless may be placed in a temporary care center if that is the best option for them.
A Temporary Expansion Shelter is a resource for people living homeless to practice social distancing. Homeless shelters will work with public health and human resources to coordinate needs and placement in an expansion shelter. Who pays for the temporary care centers?Pierce County Department of Emergency Management will cover costs for meals, food, lodging and logistics. The funding and resources come from federal and state COVID-19 funds. Who will stay at the Temporary Care Centers?Temporary Care Centers are for residents who can’t safely or practically stay at home for their assessment or recovery period when asked to by a public health professional.
Public health will work with these people to identify the best placement option.Will the Temporary Care Center be safe to use after it's done housing our community members for assessment and recovery?Yes. The Center will follow CDC cleaning guidelines. We will contract with a cleaning vendor to clean and disinfect the entire site thoroughly, like a hospital.   Will you offer on-site medical care?No, however the Temporary Care Center staff will assist with medical needs including:

Initial medical screening. 
Routine daily patient assessments.
Routine behavioral health evaluations and patient assessments.
Referral for emergency medical evaluations. 

Residents should bring their own prescribed medication (2 weeks supply) for their pre-existing health conditions. Limited basic over-the-counter medications may be available on-site.Will you provide food to residents?Yes, will deliver 3 meals each day to residents' rooms. We will also provide additional drinks and snacks as needed to support people's health. We will make accommodations for allergies and special needs.
 
We encourage each temporary care center to support local businesses and contract locally for food. We will provide a list of local vendors to each site.Testing COVID-19Do my restrictions change if I test negative?No, you should continue to practice safe distancing, wash your hands, and follow Health Department guidance. A negative test does not mean you are immune.How did testing requirements change in Phase 2?The goal for COVID-19 testing switched from finding whether a sick person has it to where is it spreading. For that reason, it’s important to test as many people as possible.How do test results get from labs to local health agencies?Information from labs go into the Washington Disease Reporting System (WDRS). This electronic disease surveillance system allows public health staff in Washington State to receive, enter, manage, process, track and analyze disease-related data.How much are uninsured patients being charged for COVID-19 testing? The Washington State Insurance Commissioner said he is working with health insurance companies and providers to waive COVID-19 testing fees and office co-pays. Talk with your provider before testing.I think I have COVID-19. What should I do?View our infographic. Talk to your healthcare provider. He or she will be able to determine if you should be tested.  If you suspect you have COVID-19 follow these steps to prevent the spread of disease:


Stay home except to get medical care.


People who have mild cases of COVID-19 can isolate at home during their illness. Restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Don’t go to work, school, or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.


Separate yourself from other people in your home. 


Stay in a specific room and away from other people and animals in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available.
Monitor your symptoms.
Seek prompt medical attention if your illness get worse. COVID-19 symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure:


Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of taste or smell.


Call ahead before you visit your doctor or an emergency room.
If you have a medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider take steps to prevent exposure to other people.I took part in a protest. Should I get tested?People who have been to a demonstration or other large gathering can get tested. If it was difficult for you to keep safe physical distance from others, then you should speak with a care provider about getting tested.What happens if I test positive? If you test positive for COVID-19, keeping you healthy is the most important thing. We check in each day with people who test positive for COVID-19 to learn about changes with symptoms and to connect them with healthcare or other services if needed. We ask people who are close contacts of people with COVID-19 to quarantine for 14 days while monitoring for any symptoms. We connect those who can’t isolate safely with options.What is antibody testing? 
Antibody tests check your blood for antibodies, which show if you had a previous infection with a virus. Antibodies are proteins that help your body fight off infections. This is also called a serology test. Serum is the technical word for blood fluid. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody test. Learn more about antibody testing on the CDC’s website.  
What should I do if an employee or someone I know is being tested?If you must go to work, ensure you don't have symptoms. You should:

Monitor yourself for symptoms.
Practice social distancing.
Stay home if you develop any symptoms.
Wash your hands.

Each disease investigation is unique. When appropriate, the Health Department provides specific guidance to organizations, businesses, schools and government officials based on possible disease exposure risk.
We encourage as many people as possible to stay home if able. If you are a close contact of a confirmed case or are experiencing symptoms, ensure you can stay home.Where can I get tested for COVID-19?Start with your healthcare provider. Both CHI Franciscan and MultiCare Health System offer free virtual appointments to people who believe they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. If needed, the healthcare provider will refer you for testing. 
Community Health Care offers testing, even if you are not their patient. Visit their website to see if you qualify and to make an appointment. 
If you don’t have a healthcare provider, visit our healthcare and help page.  Who should get tested?More people are now eligible to get tested for COVID-19. 

People who have COVID-19 symptoms, regardless of age or health status.
People who do not have symptoms but have known exposure to COVID-19.
People who have been to a demonstration or other large gathering.
People who are Black, Latinx, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Native American, or Alaska Native. These communities suffer more greatly than others from COVID-19.
Why are some communities of people singled out for testing?The COVID-19 pandemic brought disparities in our racial and ethnic communities to the forefront. As of June 11, the hardest hit communities per 100,000 people are:  

Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders (3,147 cases).  
Latinx (1,643). 
American Indian/Alaska Native (1,404). 
Blacks (1,279).
Why do you have different numbers on your data dashboards for the cases per 100,000 population over 14 days?We show our 14-day total cases per 100,000 people. In the first dashboard, we show the most recent data we have for the previous 14 days. The Safe Start dashboard reports our cases for 100,000 with a 6-day lag. The state requires this lag to allow for delays and changes in reporting. The tracking for this data began almost three weeks ago and runs for 14 consecutive days. The state requires this lag in reported data to determine if a county is eligible to apply for the next Safe Start phase. Why is it important to expand testing?More testing resources and expanded testing criteria will help public health better understand where COVID-19 is in our community. We hope to apply for Phase 3 of the Safe Start Washington plan in the weeks ahead. We can’t do that without more knowledge of COVID-19.Why should I get tested?When you get tested, you find out if you are well or if you need to take precautions to prevent those around you from getting sick. You learn about your individual health. Testing also helps public health help you—because it helps us learn about overall community health. We track test results to better understand where and how disease spreads. Will insurance cover costs for testing and treatment for COVID-19?Yes. Most health insurance plans will cover testing and treatment for medically-necessary services related to COVID-19. Commissioner Kreidler ordered all health plans his office regulates to waive copays and deductibles for people requiring testing for COVID-19. 
Copays and deductibles will still apply if you need treatment.

Return to BlogQuestions about COVID-19? We have answers. Lots of them.by Dusty Lane03/11/2020 12:43 p.m.Updated: 03/16/2020Extraordinary times call for extraordinary levels of communication. 
More than eight weeks ago, we activated an incident response team to help protect you from the novel coronavirus, now called COVID-19.
As the virus advanced across Western Washington and eventually entered Pierce County, you wanted as much information as you could get your hands on. Vast numbers of you reached out daily through the phone, email, social media and our website.  
We get it. You’re concerned about your family’s health. You want to know more about what we recommend—and why. You want to know if you should go to work or your kids should go to school—and why. You want to know when life will return to normal. (We all want to know this!)
And many important community partners have questions of their own. Schools. Businesses. Government agencies. Healthcare providers. Political leaders who need to make big decisions. Journalists who want to tell you what’s happening. People who protect our most vulnerable residents. 
The numbers tell the story of a community reaching out to its reliable source of public health information. In the last 10 days, our website received as much traffic as it normally does in three months! And that’s the tip of the iceberg:

You viewed our COVID-19 web content about 220,000 times. Monday alone, we tracked more than 50,000 times. 
Subscriptions to our blog, Your Reliable Source, grew by 2,500%.
More than 55,000 of you viewed our Facebook posts. 
More than 11,000 of you interacted with those Facebook posts.
Our Facebook following grew by more than 20% and our Twitter following grew by 35%.
You placed 516 calls to ask us questions about COVID-19.

We’re glad you’re turning to us for reliable information during this unusual time. To meet your unprecedented need for information, many staff members put aside their daily work to provide answers.  Everyone from nurses to project managers to food-establishment inspectors to administrative staff has played a role to relay accurate and timely information to you. As of March 8, 15 staff members worked about 800 hours on COVID-19 communication. They’re a part of a team of 81 staff members who have devoted more than 3,700 hours to this response effort. We appreciate your patience if we haven’t yet responded to your request.
Make sure you know how to find the information we’ve provided, and how to receive regular updates in the future:

We update our primary COVID-19 page every day at 2 p.m. with the latest numbers of positive cases in Pierce County. That page also houses the answers to many of your Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). We update those FAQs regularly in response to your feedback.
We also have pages with information for schools, businesses, healthcare providers and human services providers. Each of those pages offers more FAQs tailored to specific groups.
You can subscribe to the Your Reliable Source blog for in-depth updates.
Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. 
If you manage communications for a local organization, we offer a toolbox with dozens of ways to send helpful messages to people who rely on you. Contact us to request access.

Return to BlogHelp us Protect our Most Vulnerable Populations.by Nancy Sutton03/09/2020 5:26 p.m.Updated: 03/16/2020Laboratory testing for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing throughout state and commercial labs. This means we can test more people faster. It also means we will begin to see more COVID-19 cases throughout Pierce County and the region.
As of March 9, we have tested almost 200 Pierce County residents and have confirmed 7 positive cases. The good news is about 80% of people who get the virus will have mild symptoms and can easily recover at home.
Your health and the health of those you care about are important to us. We want to protect our most vulnerable populations. Those at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 include:

People with weakened immune systems from medical conditions or medical treatment. 
Adults over age 60.
Pregnant women.

If you are at a higher risk, we recommend you take extra measures to distance yourself from other people and stay at home. 
Skip the trip. Opt for online and delivery services.
Do you need to refill prescriptions, make a bank deposit, or do your weekly grocery shopping? Consider how you can accomplish these services online or with help from a family member. Refill prescriptions over-the-phone and have them mailed to your home. Ask a family member or neighbor to go the bank for you, or even help you download a banking app to your phone. Buy groceries online and schedule a pick-up or delivery. 
Limit social gatherings and avoid crowds.
Don’t ask your grandma to host Easter dinner this year. We recommend people over age 60 avoid gatherings with 10 or more people. People at high-risk should avoid attending events with large crowds like concerts, church and fairs or festivals. But don’t miss out! Freshen up on your technology skills and learn how to participate via video-chat with your friends and family through Skype or Facetime. Explore whether your place of worship or event offers on-line participation. 
Try a new hobby. 
Are you a regular at Monday night bingo? Now’s the time to find a new hobby you can do at home. Download a new game on your phone or computer, play solitaire, or catch-up on the latest Netflix series. 
Stay near home, but get outside. 
The days are longer, and weather is getting warmer. Try outdoor activities you can do by yourself. Work in your garden or go for a stroll around the neighborhood. 
Employers and business can also implement measures.
We encourage agencies that serve the elderly, immune compromised or pregnant woman to consider postponing special events and meetings. Now is the time to explore telework options and other flexible work situations to help those who are most vulnerable protect their health.
We are here to protect and improve the health of all people and places in Pierce County. We live that mission when you're not thinking about us, and we're living it now when you are.

Return to BlogSimple steps to protect against COVID-19.by Stephanie Dunkel02/29/2020 7:28 p.m.Updated: 02/29/2020
Most of the time, you probably don't think much about the work we do. In fact, it's easy for public health to become background noise for long stretches of time.  



We're OK with that! It means you're living your life and are not very worried about your health.  


But sometimes, we need you to hear us loud and clear when we ask you to take steps to protect your health.
The increasing risk of COVID-19 is one of those times.  


It’s troubling to hear news of more cases in our state and one death. We are saddened and thinking about all involved. While our community prepares for the possibility of COVID-19 coming here or spreading here, we can all do some things to protect ourselves.  


Panicking and spreading misinformation is not on the list.  



It can seem like what we are asking is almost too easy. But if you and your family do these things, you have a better chance of staying healthy:   




Wash your hands! Do so often. Use soap and water for at least 20 seconds. 


Avoid touching your face. Especially with unwashed hands. Your eyes, nose, and mouth are open doors for germs. 








Avoid people who are sick. Steer clear of illnesses if at all possible.  


Cover your coughs and sneezes. Hold a tissue over your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Then throw that tissue away and, again, WASH YOUR HANDS!  


Clean things. Disinfect objects and surfaces often.  


Stay home if you’re sick. This isn't the time to tough it out and leave your home if you're not feeling well.  


Call first. If you or a family member are sick and plan to seek care, call first. Our healthcare partners need to prepare for people who are showing symptoms—or direct you to the appropriate resource. 








Stay informed. Follow and share trusted sources of accurate public health information. Our website is a great place to start: www.tpchd.org/coronavirus.  




 While you don't need to panic, you do need to plan. 


We have helpful resources on our website for individuals, schools and businesses. It’s a good time for everyone to consider these things:  






Plan ways to care for those who may have health conditions.  


Get to know your neighbors. 


Be prepared for your child’s school or childcare facility to be temporarily dismissed. 


Discuss sick-leave policies and telework options with your employer.  








Washington has paid sick leave. Learn more at https://www.tpchd.org/healthy-places/food-safety/washington-s-paid-sick-leave-law  






Plan to have extra supplies in case you need to stay home for an extended time.  




 Each person on our staff is dedicated to keeping you healthy. If it were a good idea to take more drastic steps right now, we'd let you know immediately.  



We are here to protect and improve the health of all people and places in Pierce County. We live that mission when you're not thinking about us, and we're living it now when you are.

Return to BlogHow we investigate COVID-19by Stephanie Dunkel03/11/2020 4:23 p.m.Updated: 03/16/2020Disease detectives are on the case 
In some ways, disease investigation is a lot like detective work. We need to look at many pieces to complete the puzzle and diagnose people who are ill. 
Sometimes, we have all the pieces. Sometimes, we need more. For COVID-19, the investigation begins with a patient’s symptoms. 
Identifying COVID-19 
We can’t confirm COVID-19 by symptoms alone. That requires a test from a healthcare provider.  
If a person tests positive for COVID-19, the provider notifies public health. With that notification comes an investigation process by public health experts.
We first check in with the person who tested positive to see how they are. We ask the person to stay home and continue to check in with them. We work with them to better understand when their symptoms started and where they may have been during their contagious period.
We also ask the person about close contacts who would be at highest risk for getting COVID-19. Close contacts include someone who:

Lives in the same household as a sick person with COVID-19.
Cares for a sick person with COVID-19.
Was within 6 feet of a sick person with COVID-19 for about 10 minutes.
Was in direct contact with secretions from a sick person with COVID-19.

We notify close contacts at highest risk and ask them to stay home from school and work, and not participate in social gatherings for 14 days.  
We also notify agencies that may be affected as the investigation unfolds. If you were ever identified as a close contact, someone from the health department would connect with you.  
People with COVID-19 usually have three symptoms: 

Fever.
Coughing.
Shortness of breath. 

These symptoms are usually mild but can be severe.  
Symptoms can take two-14 days to appear, so it’s important to monitor them over time. People with these symptoms should stay home, separate themselves from others at home, and watch their health closely.  
Testing for COVID-19 
Laboratory testing for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing throughout the state. As we test more people, we will see an increase in cases. However, the decision to test a person is still made on a case-by-case basis. 
Your healthcare provider decides if you need to be tested. When contacting a healthcare provider about testing, it’s best to call first so they can prepare for your visit. 
Vaccine and treatment 
COVID-19 is a new virus and we are still learning about it. Right now, there is no vaccine. The National Institute for Health is working quickly to develop one. Fortunately, 80 percent of people who get COVID-19 have mild symptoms and will usually recover at home.  
For now, prevention is the best form of treatment. It’s important you take added precautions to keep COVID-19 from spreading. 
Follow basic steps to help stop the spread of the virus: 

Wash your hands with hot water and soap for at least 20 seconds. 
Avoid touching your face, mouth and eyes.
Stay home if you have a fever or cough or experience shortness of breath.
Cover sneezes and coughs with your elbow.
Disinfect frequently used surfaces such as tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, mobile devices and keyboards. 
Avoid sharing personal items like water bottles, eating utensils or towels.
Avoid large social gatherings and crowds.

Pierce County Council authorizes release of remaining CARES Act funding
 
Pierce County Council authorizes release of remaining CARES Act funding
The Pierce County Council released the remaining federal CARES Act funding it received to be available for distribution to assist with the response to the COVID-19 public health crisis.
With this authorization, the final 40 percent of the nearly $158 million will be appropriated into four previously established categories:
Public Health Emergency Response;
Economic Stabilization and Recovery Programs;
Community Response and Resilience; and
Essential Government Services.
Additionally, just over $23 million remains in a contingency reserve account. The council must review proposed expenditures and pass a resolution to release this money before it can be allocated.
“Since the start, the Pierce County Council has been actively involved in the financial allocation of these federal CARES Act funds,” Council Vice Chair Dave Morell said. “We understand the importance this assistance plays in our communities and have prioritized allocations to help people as they respond to the impacts of COVID-19.”
To-date the County Council has authorized the following allocations in each category:
$40.2 million to Public Health Emergency Response;
$18 million to Economic Stabilization and Recovery Programs;
$13.65 million to Community Response and Resilience; and
$7,320,236 to Essential Government Services.
Of the more than $79 million the Council authorized for assistance, $13.5 million was expended as of July 1. This breaks down to almost $8 million for Public Health Emergency Response, $4.5 million for Economic Stabilization and Recovery Programs, less than $1 million for Community Response and Resilience, and approximately $100,000 for Essential Government Services.

Workshop lays out basics of Social Security Disability
 
When someone experiences a disabling injury or illness, it can trigger a range of unsettling emotions and fears, not only for the person with the disability, but for their family members and friends, too. It may be comforting to know that when a long-term disability happens, Social Security Disability can provide financial support.
Join Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources for a special virtual presentation on Social Security Disability on Monday, July 13, from 4 – 5 p.m. Participants can join 
online
 or by calling 253-215-8782 or toll free at 888-788-0099. The webinar ID is 994 8047 5801. The event is free, and no RSVP is required. 
Kirk Larson, Public Affairs Specialist with the Social Security Administration, will provide participants with information on the following topics:
How to qualify and apply for benefits
What happens when an application is approved
How to appeal denials
Who can receive benefits on a person’s earnings record
What people should know about receiving disability benefits
When Medicare coverage starts for Social Security disability beneficiaries
The CDC estimates that 
1 in 4 Americans have a disability
, with the majority being between 18 and 64 years old. There are 60 million individuals receiving social security benefits, most of whom receive between $700 and $1,700 per month. While there are many variables that determine monthly payments, the financial support undoubtedly serves as a lifeline for many recipients.
“It’s amazing that so many people don’t think to turn to Social Security Disability or are confused about the benefits,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager.  “This is an opportunity to get clear information about the available disability benefits, the application process and re-employment incentives.”
Aging and Disability Resources (ADR) is a program of Pierce County Human Services. The goal of ADR is to help older adults and individuals with disabilities remain safe and independent in their own home. ADR works closely with caregivers, families, neighbors and community members to provide services, resources and supports so that people can age safely in place. For more information about ADR call the 
Aging and Disability Resource Center
 at 253-798-4600.

Workshop summarizes Medicare changes for COVID-19
 
Since the pandemic began, healthcare systems around the world have been challenged in unimaginable ways. Here at home, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have responded on a seemingly daily basis with new or revised guidance to address emerging needs across the country. The rapid changes in health care can be overwhelming for everyone during this difficult time, especially for older adults and people with chronic conditions who are receiving Medicare benefits. 
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources will host one-hour workshops for providers and professionals to learn about the changes to Medicare that have been introduced. The workshops will provide an overview of Medicare updates, enrollment options, telehealth, testing and more. This virtual experience will be offered twice this month, both online and by telephone:

Pierce County seeks public input on project to replace Milroy Bridge
 
The community can provide input about potential environmental impacts of a project to build a new bridge from Canyon Road East across the Puyallup River into the City of Fife via an online open house through Aug. 7.
The bridge project – known as the River Crossing Project – is part of the 
Canyon Road Regional Connection Project
, which will extend Canyon Road East from south of Pioneer Way East, where it ends today, to 52nd Street East, and from 52nd Street to 70th Avenue East.
Pierce County is currently undergoing an environmental review process in accordance with the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). As part of this process, Pierce County is asking the community to help identify possible effects of the project the county should study.
Visit 
openhouse.canyonroadconnection.org
 to provide feedback and learn about the project and the proposed scope of the environmental review. The community can also participate in a virtual town hall at 7 p.m. July 23 to learn more. A registration link for the virtual town hall is available at 
openhouse.canyonroadconnection.org
.
The online open house and virtual town hall are opportunities for remote participation to accommodate people while current COVID-19 social distancing guidelines are in effect.
About the project
The Canyon Road East corridor is already a commuting route for people who live in Tacoma, South Hill, Lakewood, Puyallup, and Spanaway. Once the project is constructed, it will also become a key route for freight traveling from Frederickson to the Port of Tacoma.
Currently, the only crossing between Fife and Puyallup is the functionally obsolete Milroy Bridge. Built in the 1930s, the bridge was not designed for modern commuting and does not meet the capacity needs of the region. The River Crossing Project will replace the Milroy Bridge with a new, four-lane concrete bridge over the Puyallup River.
In addition to improving traffic conditions, the River Crossing Project will improve water quality and develop a better system for how stormwater runoff is channeled in the area. The project will also identify and mitigate any impacts to fish and wildlife habitats, including stream and riparian impacts.
The public can also submit comments in the following ways:
Call a 24/7 telephone hotline at (253) 300-5101 to leave a voicemail message about the project

New sewer pump station to be built at intersection of 28th Avenue East and 182nd Street East
 
A project to extend sewer service to a 370-acre area in central Pierce County near Spanaway and Frederickson will begin June 29. The work is expected to be complete by June 2021.
A new sewer pump station will be built near the intersection of 28th Avenue East and 182nd Street East. A pump station collects wastewater and pumps it into a nearby gravity sewer system when it reaches a certain level.
Approximately 2,750 feet of force main will be installed west of the pump station along 28th Avenue East and 183rd Street Court East ending at 22nd Avenue East. Approximately 3,800 feet of gravity sewer line will be installed east of the pump station along 182nd Street East and 38th Avenue East ending at 180th Street East.
Construction work will take place from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday.
Road and lane closures will be required throughout the project. Local, business and emergency access will be provided. Closure information will be shared as it becomes available at 
www.piercecountywa.gov/28th-ave-pump-station
.  
Tucci & Sons Inc. is the contractor for the project. The estimated project cost is $7.25 million and is funded by sewer connection fees.
About the Pierce County sewer system
The Pierce County sewer system collects wastewater from a 117-square-mile area serving 294,000 people in University Place, Lakewood, DuPont, Steilacoom, Milton and a portion of Tacoma. It also serves the unincorporated communities of Parkland, Spanaway, Midland, South Hill, Tehaleh and Frederickson.

Annual property values set by Pierce County Assessor-Treasurer
 
The latest assessed values of over 327,000 parcels of property throughout Pierce County have been mailed or emailed this week to the property owners. These 2020 values will be used as the basis for property taxes to be billed in February of 2021.
“Homes in all parts of our County continue to increase in value,” said Mike Lonergan, Pierce County Assessor-Treasurer. Overall, residential properties went up 8.8% this year, compared to 7.5% in 2019, due to a continued strong real estate market.
State law requires the Assessor-Treasurer to value properties as of Jan. 1, so these values do not reflect any change that may result from the COVID-19 pandemic.  “Actually, real estate sales have continued strong so far,” Lonergan said, “and if there is a softening of the market, that will begin to show up in next year’s assessed values.” 
Lonergan cautioned homeowners not to jump to the conclusion that an increase in value will result in a tax increase. “It’s a math equation,” he said. “Your tax in 2021 will be the new 2020 value multiplied by the combined tax rates of your school district, city, fire district and so forth, added to the state and countywide property taxes that everyone pays. A lot depends on votes by the public and the Legislature.” 
Countywide averages can be misleading, because values change at varying rates in different communities. “The increase in Tacoma was slightly above the County average, bringing the typical Tacoma residence to $351,000, which is an increase of nearly $30,000,” Lonergan explained. “By contrast Roy’s increase was the lowest at six percent, for an average 2020 home value of $262,000.”     
The highest average value in the county is $534,000 in Gig Harbor, up from $489,000 in 2019. The greatest percentage increase from year to year was 10.8% in Orting, for a new average value of $323,000. 
One group of homeowners, scattered throughout much of the county, will see especially large percentage increases this year.  “Our depreciation tables were under-valuing most mobile homes by an average of 25%,” Lonergan said. “The demand for affordable housing has pushed resale prices for manufactured housing higher, and I am required by law to reflect that, so that everyone is taxed fairly.  
He added that any property owner who believes the Assessor-Treasurer has over-valued their property may appeal to the Pierce County Board of Equalization at no cost.  The appeal must be filed no later than Aug. 24, 2020, providing evidence that comparable properties have sold recently at a lower amount.

New Pierce County Ferry schedule goes into effect July 1; summer two-boat service begins July 3
 
A new Pierce County Ferry schedule will go into effect July 1. The new schedule is simplified with more consistent departure times throughout the week.
Riders can view the new schedule online at 
www.piercecountywa.gov/ferry
. Printed schedules will be available at the terminal beginning July 1.
Consistency is built into the schedule with fewer built-in modifications for specialty runs and crew training. The secondary ferry will be used for specialty runs, such as fuel trucks and midday access to Ketron Island for service contractors. Better timing of runs will allow crew training to be held between departures.
Morning and afternoon ferry run times were optimized to best meet start and end times for school-aged riders while meeting commuter and ferry operational needs. Children will arrive to school within five minutes of the start time and no delays should occur on their return trip home.
“The updated schedule provides a high level of service from morning to night,” said Randy Rogers, Pierce County Planning and Public Works airport and ferry administrator. “We worked closely with the Anderson Island Citizens Advisory Committee, residents and the Steilacoom School District to make these improvements.”
Steilacoom and Anderson Island departures occur seven days per week between the hours of 5:45 a.m. and 10:50 p.m. An early-morning commuter run continues to depart Steilacoom at 4:45 a.m. Monday – Friday.
Three daily departures from Ketron Island will occur at 6:40 a.m., 11:30 a.m. and 8:15 p.m. An additional departure will occur at 11:05 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and observed holidays.
As the 11:05 p.m. departure had 16 riders in 2019, Pierce County will monitor ridership to evaluate if this run should continue to be offered.
Ferry runs added for Independence Day and summertime travelers
The ferry will offer additional runs on July 3 and 5 to accommodate Independence Day travelers. The runs will depart Steilacoom at 12:30 p.m., 1:45 p.m., 3:15 p.m., 4:25 p.m. and 5:35 p.m.; and Ketron Island at 11:05 p.m. The ferry will follow the standard Saturday schedule on July 4.
The two-boat summer schedule will continue seven days a week through Labor Day.
Reminder: Fireworks prohibited on the ferry
Fireworks are prohibited on the ferry. Only non-aerial, non-explosive fireworks – such as sparklers – in their original packaging may be transported aboard the ferry. Fireworks of any type may not be ignited on the ferry.

Levee repair work off Foothills Trail at SR 162 and 177th Street East planned this summer
 
*June 22 update: The tree removal work has been moved to June 24.
Pierce County crews will repair about 460 feet of river levee along the Carbon River’s left bank July 15-31. The work area is off the Foothills Trail trailhead at State Route 162 and 177th Street East.
The section of the Charles Crocker Levee being repaired has been eroded by the migration of the Carbon River. It was also damaged in recent storms. Crews will remove dirt and rocks and rebuild the levee with large rocks.
Impacts to Foothills Trail
A contractor will remove about nine trees on June 22 in preparation for the levee repair work. Additional work days may be needed. Work hours will be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Visit 
www.piercecountywa.gov/CharlesCrockerLevee
 for schedule updates.
Foothills Trail users should expect intermittent delays at the trailhead during the tree removal work. A flagger will direct trail users while the work is underway.
The levee repair work will take place July 15-31. Work hours will run from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday to Friday.
The trail will remain open during the work. The picnic area near the trailhead will be closed during work hours. Bike racks near the picnic area will be inaccessible.
Trail users should be cautious in the work area and remain on the trail. They should not go past the closure barricades.
This work is part of Pierce County’s annual river levee maintenance program. Previous work in this area includes a 2013 repair of 250 feet of levee just downstream of this year’s section.

Pierce County learned today the county’s application to move to Phase 2 was approved by the state Department of Health.  The move to the second phase is effective immediately.
“I’m pleased that our residents’ hard work to social distance and abide by best practices has been recognized,” said Executive Bruce Dammeier.  “While we are eager to see some of the restrictions lifted, I urge our community to continue with the practices that protect themselves, their families and our community.”
Activities allowed under Phase 2, with certain restrictions, include restaurants at 50% capacity, in-store retail at 30% capacity and the re-opening of salons, barbers and other personal grooming services.
The County is expected to remain in Phase 2 for at least three weeks and can apply to move to the next phase when prescribed COVID-19 targets have been achieved.
“We’ve spent this week handing out a million masks to our local businesses, nonprofits and houses of worship for just this day,” said Council Chair Doug Richardson. “It’s great to know that they will have the PPE they need in time to safely re-open.”

Ken Farmer named head of Pierce County Disaster Recovery Office
 
Executive Bruce Dammeier has appointed Retired Major General Kenneth Farmer, M.D., to lead Pierce County’s Office of Disaster Recovery. A noted military leader and physician, Dr. Farmer will help guide Pierce County’s efforts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. He begins serving in this six-month role immediately.
Farmer, a retired Major General with the U.S. Army, has a long and distinguished career in both the public and private sectors.
“We are fortunate to have found a remarkable leader of Dr. Farmer’s caliber in our own community,” said Bruce Dammeier. “His experience in managing large-scale, international operations combined with his expertise in medical care make him an ideal person to organize our recovery efforts.”
The creation of a temporary Office of Disaster Recovery is provided for in the County’s 2014 Disaster Recovery Plan. Dr. Farmer will coordinate recovery plans with county leadership, county department directors and the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department.
Farmer served as the Deputy Surgeon General of the Army and the Commanding General of Walter Reed Hospital.
After retiring from the Army, Farmer served almost seven years as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of TriWest Healthcare Alliance.
In 2013, he formed a consulting business focused on healthcare management, strategy, and business development.
Farmer served as CEO of Careage, Inc. from October 2016 to January 2019.  Careage, based in Gig Harbor, Wash., owns and operates senior living communities, skilled nursing rehabilitation, home healthcare, construction, development and management services in Washington and California. He remains on the Careage Board of Directors.
Farmer resides in Steilacoom.

Pierce County Fair goes virtual in 2020
 
Sent on behalf of the Pierce County Fair
Out of an abundance of caution, Pierce County and the Pierce County Fair Association have decided to go virtual with the 2020 Pierce County Fair, normally held at Frontier Park in Graham.
“We know how much the community enjoys and values the Fair and we will be working diligently to create an experience everyone can enjoy,” said Shelly Bennett, manager of the Pierce County Fair. “We are researching virtual fair options in order to move forward in showcasing and celebrating the Pierce County community and its youth.”
The Fair is scheduled for Aug. 6-9, but organizers are announcing this decision now so that friends, sponsors, vendors, and the community can be prepared for a virtual fair this year.
“While we wish we could go ahead with the usual sights, smells and excitement of the Pierce County Fair, we have been working with 4-H and other fairs around the state to develop virtual, web-based alternatives,” said Bennett. “Our hearts go out to those who depend on the Fair for their livelihood and we are looking for ways the community can show their support to our vendors, sponsors, entertainers and others who have been impacted.”
“Fair organizers are actively working with the County and 4-H, looking for a safe and healthy way for 4-H Youth to showcase their animals and projects. Our young people have been working hard all year and we feel it is important to recognize their efforts.” said Bennett.
Updates and further information will be available via the Pierce County Fair’s social media platforms.

State loan program to open new doors for Pierce County Airport-Thun Field hangar tenants
 
A $750,000 low-interest loan from Washington State’s Community Aviation Revitalization Board (CARB) will be used to install power-assisted doors at 50 Pierce County Airport-Thun Field airplane hangars. 
The Pierce County Council approved participation in the CARB’s loan program May 12. 
Most Pierce County-owned hangars at the airport do not have quality doors to protect airplanes from inclement weather. This project will increase hangar security, value and the overall appeal of the airport.
“Our customers want the added weather protection offered by quality doors,” said Rod Propst, Pierce County Planning and Public Works airport manager. “This improvement will enhance the hangar facilities to better meet customer needs and shows our commitment to the general aviation community in the South Sound.”
The CARB loan program is administered by the Washington State Department of Transportation’s Aviation Division. The program provides up to $750,000, a two-percent interest rate and up to a 20-year payment term. The program is available to airports with fewer than 75,000 annual commercial flights. 
The program is for revenue-producing capital projects that help public-use general aviation airports become more self-sustainable. Eligible projects include hangars, fueling facilities, business parks and other revenue-generating or cost-cutting developments.
 “The Pierce County Council had made General Fund allocations toward the revitalization of Pierce County Airport -Thun Field in the 2020-2021 budget. The CARB Loan gives Pierce County the ability to reduce the burden on the General Fund,” said Pierce County Councilmember Dave Morell. “The maintenance and preservation of this asset is vital to the South Hill community and all of Pierce County.”
Thun Field is a public 163-acre general aviation airport and is an important community transportation and emergency services facility. Approximately 265 aircraft are based at the airport, with more than 103,000 non-commercial take-offs and landings each year. The airport is in the South Hill area and is approximately five miles south of the Washington State Fairgrounds and 25 miles from Mount Rainier.

Traffic signal system coming to 38th Avenue East and 152nd Street East intersection May 5
 
A new traffic signal system will be activated at the 38th Avenue East and 152nd Street East intersection on May 5.
The activation is weather dependent. The intersection is located to the east of Naches Trail Elementary School.
Work on the intersection project began in mid-August 2019. Crews installed curbs, gutters, sidewalks and curb ramps at the intersection, along with electrical infrastructure for the new signal. The corners of the intersection were reconstructed to accommodate larger vehicles. Crews repaved the intersection in October.
The work was put on hold – or suspended – in October while traffic signal poles were being delivered. Work resumed April 13, with crews installing the signal poles, street lights, signal cabinets and final pavement markings.
Titan Earthwork LLC is the contractor. 
The construction cost is approximately $670,000 and is funded with Pierce County traffic impact fees and Federal Highway Safety Improvement Funds.

Pierce County Parks to open May 5; Chambers Bay opens May 1
 
Pierce County is restoring public use of parks with protocols and guidelines to keep the public safe. Park and trailhead parking lots will open May 5, while Chambers Creek Regional Park will open earlier, on May 1. 
Parks outdoor spaces will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. Restrooms will remain closed at all parks and trailheads. 
Additional protocols have been created to promote respectful use, including limiting travel, shortening stays, and social distancing. Recreation centers, playgrounds, picnic shelters and fields at athletic complexes will remain closed.
These services align with Gov. Jay Inslee’s 
announcement
 authorizing increased access to public lands for outdoor recreation outings. 
Crowded parks may result in future closures, so everyone is encouraged to work together and abide by the guidelines below for safe and respectful park, open space and trail use.  
Pierce County Parks Safety Protocols
Limit Travel
Recreate within your home county and home community. 
Use the park closest to your home. If you can walk there, please do so.
Understand that some people don’t have the ability to walk to their local park and must drive, so leave parking stalls for them.
Limit Stays 
If you drive to a park/trailhead and parking is not available, then the site is at capacity. Do not park in unauthorized areas or in neighborhoods. Come back later.  
Keep your visit to two hours or less and go no more than twice a week to make sure there is room for everyone. 
Try to avoid peak hours of the day and instead consider going when it’s not as sunny. 
Public restrooms in the parks are not available at this time. 
Limit Contact 
Stay home if you are sick or at high risk. 
Stay six feet away from anyone who doesn’t live with you. 
Avoid contact with items that don’t belong to you. 
Wear a mask if you are going to be around others. 
Bring supplies with you to wash and sanitize regularly. 
When in the Park
 
Stay off play structures and out of picnic shelters. 
Only use sport courts with your own family and your own play equipment; fields at athletic complexes will remain closed. 
Only one family or household group per picnic table. Please bring a table covering to use and take it with you when you leave. 
Stay in your family or household group and if you are using lawn space, make sure it is at least 25 feet from others who are doing the same. 
When on a Trail
Follow one-way directional arrows and looping (where indicated). 
If two-way use occurs, provide proper distancing upon passage. Do not pass if six feet cannot be maintained. 
Public gatherings, events, team sports and other activities, are not permitted at this time. Pierce County Parks will continue to follow safety protocols and restrictions in accordance with Gov. Inslee’s “dialing back” of COVID-19 related restrictions.

Pierce County Law Library receives prestigious community engagement award
 
The Pierce County Law Library was recently awarded the prestigious Excellence in Community Engagement Award for its innovative “library within a library” collaboration with the Pierce County Library System.  
The award, granted by the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL), honors outstanding achievement in community relations activities by AALL members or affiliates. Its intent is to inspire, educate and encourage community engagement.
The 2019 award highlights the Pierce County Law Library’s innovative approach to serving the legal needs of residents in remote areas. The award honors the collaboration of two public libraries sharing resources to establish a satellite law library branch inside the Lakewood Public Library. A satellite branch in Gig Harbor was similarly established the previous year.
“The work of the Pierce County Law Library is to make legal information accessible to all residents, even those living in remote areas of the County. Our partnership with the Pierce County Public Library allowed us to take the law out of the courthouse and to the neighborhoods where people live and work. The success of these branch libraries proves that legal information is a resource everyone needs and should be available without cost,” said Pierce County Law Library Board of Trustees President James H. Bush.
The library collaboration, which began in 2016, has resulted in two satellite branch law libraries coming online at the Gig Harbor Public Library and Lakewood Public Library, two of Pierce County Library’s largest libraries. Nearly 490,000 people visited the two libraries in 2019. The Gig Harbor satellite branch opened June 14, 2018, and the Lakewood satellite followed on May 28, 2019. 
The two satellite branches have print and electronic collections that are responsive to the needs of local residents. Law Library surveys of local patrons informed the emphasis on elder law and probate resources for Gig Harbor, and family law and landlord tenant law at Lakewood. 
Branch library services also include regularly scheduled in-person reference assistance. Legal workshops are held at both locations to assist residents with legal issues of interest to those communities.  
“The [Pierce County Library] partnership with Pierce County Law Library is another example of good government as we collaborate to make information and resources available to more people,” said Pierce County Library Executive Director Georgia Lomax. “Having [the satellite branches] easily accessible in a public library brings legal resources to more people in a convenient place.”
The award presentation is scheduled for the AALL Annual meeting in July 2020. The nomination was submitted by Barbara Engstrom, executive director of the King County Law Library.  
For more information about the Pierce County Law Library and its satellite branch law libraries contact Laurie Miller at

Most users of the law library are referred by the co-located Superior, District or Municipal courts. The law library staff of four librarians and technicians welcome about 220 users through the doors daily. Approximately 90% of reference questions come from non-attorneys.

Pierce County Council allocates an additional $3 million in small business funding and $500,000 in f
 
Today, the Pierce County Council took strong steps to support Pierce County residents and business owners struggling with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Building on the COVID-19 Emergency Small Business Relief Loan Program the Council previously created, councilmembers passed an emergency ordinance that expands the program’s funding by $3 million. 
In addition to increasing the funding available, the program eligibility has also been expanded to include employers with up to 20 employees for businesses located anywhere in Pierce County, including incorporated cities. 
“As a Council, we are concerned with the significant health impacts of COVID-19, as well as the vitality of our communities.  Our small businesses are the heart of the economic foundation of Pierce County,” said Council Chair Doug Richardson.
The Pierce County Council created the COVID-19 Emergency Small Business Relief Loan Program on March 24, 2020 with the allocation of $640,000 for small businesses of ten or fewer employees in unincorporated Pierce County. The program, administered by the Pierce County Economic Development Department, was designed to keep businesses located in unincorporated Pierce County in operation and protect jobs threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Economic Development Department started reviewing loan applications on March 26. 
To date, more than 198 applications have been received from Pierce County businesses, including 86 companies located in incorporated Pierce County.  With more than 55 loans approved, the initial funding has nearly been expended. 
An application and information can be found at
 https://www.piercecountywa.gov/6770/Emergency-Small-Business-Relief-Loan-Pro
, by emailing 
PCSBRLoan@piercecountywa.gov
  or calling 253-798-6150.
In other action, by emergency ordinance the Council also tripled its funding for the Emergency Food Network to provide food security to those in need during these unprecedented times. The Council provided in additional $500,00 in funding to the $250,000 previously approved in March 2020 for food banks throughout Pierce County. 
Nourishing the residents of the County is critically important as the region recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Construction project on section of Canyon Road East expected to start April 8
 
Construction on a project to enhance safety and relieve traffic congestion on Canyon Road East between 99th Street Court East and 84th Street East is expected to start April 8. 
Crews will work 7 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday. The road may periodically be reduced to one lane with alternating traffic between 8:30 a.m. and 3 p.m.
A significant portion of the construction work is expected to be completed by February 2021. Minor work will continue through February 2022. If a winter suspension is needed due to weather, this schedule could be impacted.
About the project
Canyon Road East from 96th Street East to 84th Street East will be widened to five lanes, with two through lanes in each direction and a two-way left-turn lane. This section will have paved shoulders, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.  
Canyon Road East from 99th Street Court East to 96th Street East will be widened to four lanes, with two through lanes in each direction. This section will have paved shoulders and barrier curbs on the west side, and curbs, gutters, and sidewalks on the east side. 
A new traffic signal will be added at the Canyon Road East and 96th Street East intersection. The Canyon Road East and 84th Street East intersection will be widened, and a new traffic signal system will be installed to accommodate the new configuration. 
Street lighting, an enclosed storm drain system, and stormwater storage and treatment facilities will be added as part of the project. 
Construction schedule
Utility relocation work began in 2019 and continues with communications companies relocating facilities.
Construction work will begin on the east side of the project, with crews clearing the project site through mid-May. Work to install storm drainage facilities will run from mid-April to early June. A 35-foot-long retaining wall will be built about 200 feet east of the Canyon Road East and 84th Street East intersection from June to early October. 
Crews will install street lights and traffic signal system infrastructure from late June to late September. Curbs and gutters will be installed from late July to late September, while sidewalks and curb ramps will be installed from August to mid-September. Paving work is expected to take place in September, although the work is weather dependent. 
Work is scheduled to shift to the west side of the project in September, with crews installing drainage facilities, street lights, traffic signal system infrastructure, curbs, gutters and sidewalks. Paving work is expected to take place in December 2020, although the work is weather dependent.
From October to February, crews will finish paving and will restripe the road into the new configuration. This work is weather dependent. The new traffic signal systems will be activated after the restriping work.
Landscaping maintenance is expected to run through February 2022.
Rhino Construction is the contractor, and will follow updated safety guidelines that comply with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The construction cost is approximately $8.9 million and is funded with County Road Funds, Traffic Impact Fees and Washington State Transportation Improvement Board Urban Arterial Program funds.

County Assessor-Treasurer extends property tax due date to June 1
 
Citing the financial impact of the COVID-19 virus on Pierce County residents, Assessor-Treasurer Mike Lonergan, in coordination with the County Finance Director, has extended the due date for first-half property tax payments to June 1, 2020.  Interest charges will not be assessed on payments made by that date.
With record levels of people filing for unemployment and business closures mandated by Governor Jay Inslee, taxpayers have looked to local and federal government officials for financial help.
“We want to give what relief we can to many taxpayers facing financial challenges during the public health emergency,” said Assessor-Treasurer Mike Lonergan.  “At the same time, local governments are needed more than ever right now, and the property tax is a major funding source for many needed services.  Postponing the due date by a month is the best way to balance these needs.”  
The property tax payment extension only applies to taxpayers who pay their residential and commercial property taxes themselves, rather than through a mortgage lender or servicer. Banks and other financial institutions that pay property taxes on behalf of mortgage customers must meet the original April 30 deadline.  
Property owners who can pay their taxes now are encouraged to do so by April 30, or as soon thereafter as possible.  Unpaid taxes from previous years are excluded from the extension.
Payments may be made:
By mail
 to Pierce County Finance, P.O. Box 11621, Tacoma WA 98411.  Make checks payable to Pierce County and please include payment stub or parcel number.
Online
 using e-check, debit card or credit card at 
www.piercecountywa.gov/atr
 or by calling our automated telephone system at (253) 798-3333 Please have your parcel number ready.  A handling fee is added by an outside vendor: 50 cents for e-check, $3.50 for debit and 2.35% for credit card.
Secure drop box
 at Pierce County Annex, 2401 S. 35th St., Tacoma.  Do not pay in cash.  In-person payments at the Assessor-Treasurer’s office are suspended until further notice. 
This move is consistent with extensions from King and Snohomish county treasurers, who are offering similar payment relief in their jurisdictions. The payment deadline cannot be extended past June 1, as many cities, counties, school districts, fire districts, hospital districts, and other special purpose districts rely on the year’s first installment of property tax revenue to make June debt service payments.

Council approves emergency ordinances related to COVID-19
 
Pierce County Councilmembers acted today on four urgency ordinances to immediately provide support, relief and resources for individuals and companies impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Council passed 
Urgency Ordinance No. 2020-43
 to declare an emergency and establish a loan program for small businesses.  Under certain qualifying circumstances, businesses may apply for zero-interest, twelve-month loans at $2,000 per employee, with a total amount per employer not to exceed $10,000. The loan fund will be administered by the Pierce County Economic Development Department.
To support funding of the program under Urgency Ordinance No. 2020-43, the Council adopted 
Urgency Ordinance No. 2020-42
 to amend the current biennial budget by reallocating $640,000 to the program to support businesses.
The Council passed 
Urgency Ordinance No. 2020-44
 to provide economic relief for Pierce County sewer customers. The ordinance waives penalties or interest on delinquent sewer payments during the 90-day period from the March 6, 2020 emergency declaration.  Additionally, commercial sewer customers will be charged based upon actual usage instead of water usage from the prior year, to reflect the relief restaurants and other businesses may need at this time.  This relief may be extended for an additional 90 days upon notice to the Council.
The Council passed 
Urgency Ordinance No. 2020-36
 changing the effective date of the implementation of the Alternative Commercial Connection Charge Program under the declared emergency from April 1, 2020 to September 1, 2020.  The Alternative Commercial Connection Charge Program was adopted September 3, 2019 under Ordinance No. 2019-28s.

Pierce County sewer system seeing increase in non-flushable items
 
There has been an increase in non-flushable items in the public sewer system managed by Pierce County in recent days.
Only toilet paper and what comes from the human body should be flushed down the toilet. Items such as hygiene and disinfecting wipes and paper towels can clog sewer pipes, cause backups in homes and cause severe damage to the sewer system. Even wipes labeled as “flushable” will clog pipes.
Flushing other items down the toilet can be costly to homeowners. Property owners are responsible for the part of the sewer line that runs from the house to the public lines. Property owners on a septic tank have full responsibility for maintenance and repair.

Annual county roadside herbicide applications start March 23
 
Pierce County roadsides will get an annual makeover this spring and summer.
An initial application of herbicides to combat weeds along road shoulders will start March 23 and continue through June. Targeted noxious weeds and brush control applications will occur through the end of November as needed. Only federal and state-approved herbicides are used.
Pierce County road crews will also mow, cut brush and trim trees along roads during the spring and summer. The work, which will be carried out weather permitting, is part of Pierce County’s integrated roadside vegetation management program.
“Properly maintained roadsides are important for the safety of motorists and pedestrians,” said Bruce Wagner, Pierce County Planning and Public Works Maintenance and Operations Division manager.
Annual maintenance reduces fire danger, optimizes storm water drainage, helps control noxious weeds and non-native plants, and promotes native plant growth.
“Owner Will Maintain” agreements
Property owners who do not want the roadside vegetation adjacent to their properties sprayed with herbicides or mechanically trimmed can sign an “Owner Will Maintain” agreement with Pierce County. Under this agreement, the property owner agrees to maintain the vegetation. If the property owner does not meet the standards detailed in the agreement, the maintenance of the right-of-way reverts to the county.
The owner must display a Pierce County-provided sign indicating their participation in the program prior to the application of herbicides.
Property owners can call (253) 798-6000 to sign up or renew an agreement. The process will be completed via mail. Visit 
www.piercecountywa.gov/ownermaintain
 for more information.

Work to install University Place sewer main and rehabilitate pump station starts March 23
 
A project to rehabilitate a wastewater pump station and install a new sanitary sewer force main in University Place will start March 23. The work is expected to be completed in September.
This project will increase sewer capacity to allow continued growth in University Place.
Construction will take place along Morrison Road West, approximately 650 feet south of 27th Street West. Work hours will be 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Installation of the force main will require crews to cut a six-foot-deep trench in the roads along the approximately half-mile project area.
Morrison Road West, 35th Street West and 72nd Avenue Court West will remain open during construction, although the roads may be reduced to one lane with alternating traffic. Flaggers will be on-site to direct traffic, but motorists should expect delays.
The pump station currently directs wastewater to the City of Tacoma’s sewer system before being pumped back to Pierce County’s system. Rehabilitation of the pump station will include upgrading electrical systems and pumps to extend the useful service life of the facility.
Because of growth in the sewer system’s service area, the amount of wastewater being sent to the City of Tacoma has exceeded contractual limits. Instead of renegotiating the contract, Pierce County has decided to build a new force main and redirect flows south to the Chambers Creek Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The new force main will be approximately a half-mile long. It will be connected to the pump station and will run along the northbound lane of Morrison Road West, east along 35th Street West, and south along 72nd Avenue Court West. The force main will connect to an existing 10-inch sewer main located on a City of University Place property south of 72nd Avenue Court West.
Northwest Cascade, Inc. is the project’s contractor. The project is estimated to cost $1.4 million and is funded with Pierce County sewer rehabilitation and replacement funds.

Meridian Avenue East sewer project underway March 23 to mid-July
 
A project to extend sewer facilities under Meridian Avenue East (State Route 161) at several South Hill intersections will begin March 23. The work is expected to be complete by mid-July.
Work will be done at the highway’s intersections with 146th Street East, 147th Street East, 149th Street East and 158th Street East. This project will extend sewer availability to the other side of the highway from existing sewer mains in the South Hill area. New manholes will be installed at each intersection.
Work at the Meridian Avenue East and 146th Street East, 147th Street East and 158th Street East intersections will occur in the highway right-of-way and will not require lane closures on Meridian Avenue East. Crews will work from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday.
Work at the Meridian Avenue East and 149th Street East intersection is expected to begin mid-May. There will be nighttime closures of up to two southbound lanes from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Monday to Wednesday and from midnight to 6 a.m. Thursday. Traffic will be able to pass through the work zone using the middle turn-only lane. All lanes will remain open during daytime hours.
Crews will work for approximately two weeks at each intersection.
Local, business and emergency access will be provided.
Northwest Cascade Inc. is the contractor for this project. The estimated project cost is $1.5 million and is funded by the Sewer Facility Restricted Reserve Fund.

Planning Commission makes final recommendations on updates to four community plans
 
The Pierce County Planning Commission made its final recommendations on updates to the Frederickson, Mid-County, Parkland-Spanaway-Midland and South Hill community plans March 10 and 12.
Community plans provide direction on how growth and development will occur. The plans address topics such as zoning, transportation, the look and feel of the community, and access to services and amenities. 
The commission’s final recommendations on each plan, associated development regulations and amendments to the Pierce County Comprehensive Plan are anticipated to be submitted to the Pierce County Council by March 26. 
The council is anticipated to begin considering the proposed changes for each plan this spring. There will be opportunities for in-person and written public comment during the council’s review process. Information on future council meetings will be posted at 
www.piercecountywa.gov/council
.
Notable recommendations
The commission recommended approval of the Centers and Corridors proposal with some modifications to zoning requirements, such as allowed density, height and parking. The proposal would focus growth along Pacific Avenue/State Route 7, Meridian/State Route 161, 176th Street East, 112th Street East and Canyon Road East. 
The Planning Commission also included policies that support considering impact fees for fire and emergency services.

Powerful Tools for Caregivers benefit everyone
 
According to statistics, someone turning 65 today has a 70% chance of needing long-term care. While this may cause some people to dread over the potentially devastating costs of a care facility, it may be comforting to know that 75% of all long-term care is given at home by unpaid family caregivers.
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources is offering “Powerful Tools for Caregivers,” a free six-week series that provides unpaid family caregivers with skills and confidence. Participants receive a copy of “The Caregiver Helpbook,” and learn how to provide better care for themselves while caring for others.
“Powerful Tools for Caregivers”
 will be offered Friday afternoons from 2-3:30 p.m. Classes will run April 3 – May 8 at the Pierce County Soundview building, located at 3602 Pacific Ave. Suite 200, in Tacoma. Topics addressed include:
Taking care of yourself
Identifying and reducing personal stress
Communicating feelings, needs and concerns
Communication in challenging situations
Learning from our emotions
Mastering caregiving decisions
Caregivers do everything from buying groceries and running errands to managing medications and providing medical care. Family members who provide care to individuals with chronic or disabling conditions are at risk themselves. Emotional, mental, and physical health problems may arise from complex caregiving situations, as well as the strains of caring for frail or disabled relatives. Unfortunately, it is not unheard of for a caregiver to pass away before their care recipient.
“Caregiving is not something that family members train for,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “We are often thrust into that situation by circumstances out of our control. We are glad to do this and feel rewarded by it, but if the demands are heavy, over time we can also become exhausted and stressed – the dangerous downside of caregiving. ‘Powerful Tools’ provides guidance and training to help caregivers with their number one task, self-care.”
“Powerful Tools for Caregivers” is a free educational series. Space is limited and participants must attend all six sessions. Advanced reservations must be made by calling 253-798-4423. For more information about the classes, contact the 
Aging and Disability Resource Center
 at 253-798-4600.

Babies welcome: Pierce County Prosecutor lets employees bring infants to work
 
If you see more people sporting Baby Bjorns as they head into work at the Pierce County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, there’s a reason. The office is launching a new “Infants in the Workplace” pilot program, where employees may bring their small infants with them to work. The prosecutor’s office is the first county agency to allow babies in the workplace.
“I’m excited for this pilot program and what it means for young families in our office,” Prosecuting Attorney Mary Robnett said. “I’m hopeful we’ll see clear benefits, not only for the parents and babies but also the office.”
“It will mean lower childcare costs for young families and reduced feeding stress on the infants. For the office, giving employees this option will help people stay in their current positions and lower our turnover costs. It will be a boon to recruitment as well, a new way to attract high-quality applicants,” said Robnett.
The program is open to employees with infants between six weeks and nine months of age who are not yet crawling. Parents will provide their own supplies and equipment and must find two co-workers willing to briefly serve as care providers for the infant, should the need arise.
Deputy prosecutor Annie Yu said that “even knowing we have the option” is important for working parents trying to balance professional and home life. “It means a lot to have an employer that is open to this. Those first months with a new baby are so important. The more time the parents and baby can spend together, the better.”
While the prosecutor’s office is the first Pierce County agency to launch such a program, the idea has already been tested successfully in several state agencies, including the Attorney General’s Office. The state Dept. of Health was the first, starting its pilot program in 2015.
“We’ve seen this work in other agencies, and thankfully we get to build off of their lessons learned,” said Gayle Robbins, Human Resources Manager for the prosecutor’s office. “When we near the end of the pilot program, everyone will have a chance to give their input about what worked and what didn’t. But if our experience is anything like these other workplaces, the benefits will be obvious.”
Said Robnett, “The science is really clear that child-parent bonding is especially important in those early months. As an office, we want to support that. I’m confident we’ll find, as agencies elsewhere have, that there are many upsides for the office as well.”

Workshop examines pros and cons of reverse mortgages
 
With a strong housing market over the past several years, home prices have risen dramatically. As a result, many older adults have significant equity in their homes. Medical costs and long-term care costs have also risen dramatically, approximately 6% and 4% respectively.  
Reverse mortgages (also known as a 
Home Equity Conversion Mortgage
 or HECM) have been around since 1961 and have become a viable option for older adult homeowners seeking to take advantage of their equity. A reverse mortgage is a loan available to homeowners, 62 years or older, that allows them to convert part of their home equity into cash. The product was created to help retirees with limited income use the accumulated wealth in their homes to pay for health care and cover basic monthly living expenses.
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources is hosting free presentations on reverse mortgages where participants will learn the pros and cons of the program, as well as who should and should not consider it. Presentations will be held four times in March:  
March 16 – Noon at the Pierce County Annex, Main Meeting Room, 2401 S. 35th, Tacoma 
March 16 – 6:30 p.m. at the Puyallup Library, 324 S. Meridian, Puyallup
March 18 – 6:30 p.m. at the Parkland/Spanaway Library, 13718 Pacific Ave. S., Tacoma
March 21 – 10:30 a.m. at the South Hill Library, 15420 Meridian E., South Hill
“There are many misconceptions around Reverse Mortgages,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “Bad experiences early on lead to a bad reputation. With time and regulation, Reverse Mortgages have become a viable financial tool for older adults who want another way to pay for long-term medical expenses, care at home or in a facility. Even so, people need to know the details before taking the leap to a Reverse Mortgage”
These are impartial, information-only presentations. No RSVP is required. Presentations are free and open to the public. For more information, call the 
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resource Center
 at 253-798-4600 or 800-562-0332. In case of inclement weather, call 253-798-8787 for necessary postponement or cancellation.

Pierce County Council adopts county's Parks, Recreation and Open Space Plan
 
The Pierce County Council passed a 10-year plan for development of Pierce County’s park system Feb. 11. The Parks, Recreation and Open Space Plan (PROS) will guide improvements of more parks and trails than has been possible over the past 30 years.
The plan matches the needs for park and trail assets with available county, state and federal funding sources and provides a blueprint to meet needs and accomplish many projects in the upcoming decade. Projects include a mix of improvements and expansions to existing facilities and development of new facilities that will serve residents across unincorporated Pierce County.
“Pierce County Parks worked closely with the community, recreation advocacy groups, and the Pierce County Council to develop a plan that will define the improvement and expansion of our park system over the next 10 years,” said Roxanne Miles, Pierce County Parks and Recreation director. “This plan is important for us to make sure our facilities can keep pace with growth and for our residents to see our long-term plan for building and improving parks in neighborhoods across Pierce County.”

Background:
Pierce County updates its Parks, Recreation and Open Space Plan every six years to maintain eligibility for Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office grant funding. The plan provides the long-term plan for parks, trails, open space, and recreation programs offered by Pierce County. The Plan includes an inventory of the existing Pierce County Parks system, an assessment of the demand and need for park facilities throughout unincorporated Pierce County, a 2020-2030 capital improvement plan, and more.

Funny film explores outsourcing retirement
 
Television shows and movies make traveling in retirement look easy. Pick up a brochure, look at a map, pack your bags and discover a new country while living the retirement of your dreams. But that’s Hollywood, not reality.
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources continues the 
Images of Aging
 film series with “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,” an amusing movie that proves the adage if just about anything can go wrong, it will go wrong. This 2011 comedy-drama is rated PG-13 and stars award-winning actors Judi Dench and Bill Nighy as retirees hoodwinked into taking a leap of faith and moving to an exotic retirement hotel in India. Though less luxurious than advertised, the hotel slowly begins to charm in unexpected ways.  The film also highlights that friendships and romantic relationships can flourish well into retirement, giving life new value and meaning.  
“The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” will be shown on Saturday, March 14, at the Grand Cinema, located at 606 Fawcett Ave. in Tacoma. Doors open at 10:30 a.m. and the film begin at 10:45 a.m. 
 Tickets are free
 but must be obtained in advance online or by calling the Pierce County Aging and Disability Resource Center at 253-798-4600.
“Who doesn’t fantasize about living in a far-off land where everything is perfect,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “The filmmakers have used that popular image as a wonderful way to look at how we are never too old to learn about ourselves, make new friends and possibly even discover new romances.”
Each film in this series is free and open to the public. Tickets are available one month prior to showing. Seats are general admission and given on a first come, first serve basis. For more information about the films call the Pierce County Aging and Disability Resource Center at 253-798-4600 or 1-800-562-0332.

Pierce County Council approves plan to bring existing pedestrian facilities into ADA compliance
 
A plan to bring existing pedestrian facilities – including sidewalks, curb ramps, pedestrian push buttons and driveway entrances – into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
was approved by the Pierce County Council
 Feb. 11.
Pierce County’s Americans with Disabilities Act Transition Plan for Public Rights-of-Way applies to county-owned facilities within the public road right-of-way in unincorporated Pierce County.
“After a great deal of work and collaboration with our partners, we are thrilled to have an adopted plan that better serves Pierce County. This plan provides direction on how we will make pedestrian facilities more accessible for our community,” said 
Council Chair Doug Richardson, District 6
.
The plan includes elements such as how facilities will be evaluated for compliance, how facilities will be prioritized for improvement, how much it will cost to improve each type of facility, funding sources, and a timeline for improvements. It also includes design standards and procedure improvements to achieve compliance for new infrastructure. 
Approximately $100 million is needed to bring existing facilities into compliance, based on the 2018 facility inventory. The county will update its list of ADA-focused projects each year. A 
project
 to improve accessibility and sidewalk connectivity along Gem Heights Drive East between 176th Street East and 168th Street East is currently under design, and is expected to be constructed this summer.
The plan will be updated every five years to track progress, refine prioritization methods, and update program costs. Each update will include a public comment period.
Public comment on the draft ADA Transition Plan was accepted in August 2019. Pierce County staff incorporated the feedback into the final plan.
An online open house that provides a high-level overview of the plan is available at 
www.piercecountywa.gov/ADAtransition
.  
Background
Pierce County was required under Title II of the ADA to develop a Self-Evaluation Report and an ADA Transition Plan. 
Pierce County’s Americans with Disabilities Act Public Rights-of-Way Self-Evaluation Report, which was completed in 2015, included the examination of county policies related to the ADA and an inventory that identified whether existing pedestrian facilities were in compliance with the ADA. This inventory was initially completed in 2015 and is updated as new facilities are built or improved.
As part of the self-evaluation process, Pierce County gathered feedback from the public about which types of pedestrian facility defects pose the biggest impact to accessibility, and which locations are most important for the public to be able to reach without barriers to access. The feedback was gathered at four public meetings held in November 2014 and from an online survey. The Self-Evaluation Report is available at 
www.piercecountywa.gov/ADAtransition

“Five Wishes” preserves dignity and respect in care planning
 
Thinking ahead is always important. Whether you’re hosting a party, making a kit for a natural disaster, or grocery shopping, planning is essential to feeling thoroughly prepared. Even though we hope for the best, it makes sense to plan for the worst.
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources
, in collaboration with Fir Lane Memorial Park, is hosting free presentations of “Five Wishes,” the advance care planning program that is quickly becoming America’s most popular living will. “Five Wishes,” is changing the way we talk about and plan for care at the end of life. This easy-to-use legal advance directive document is written in everyday language to help all adults, regardless of age or health, consider and record how they want to be cared for at the end of life.
The “
Five Wishes
” presentations will explore wishes surrounding personal, medical, emotional, familial and spiritual concerns. Sessions will be held three times in February:
Feb. 24 - Noon at the Pierce County Annex, Main Meeting Room, 2401 S. 35th, Tacoma
Feb. 24 - 6:30 p.m. at the Graham Branch Library, 9202 224th St. E., Graham
Feb. 26 - 6:30 p.m. at Fir Lane Memorial Park, 924 176th St. E., Spanaway
“Five Wishes” helps people express their choices in areas that matter most, describes what good care means and whether someone is seriously ill or not. This document tells family members and caregivers exactly what you want, and it meets the legal requirements in most states, including Washington. Attendees will receive a complimentary copy of the “Five Wishes” book as well as valuable supplementary materials.
“We go to the doctor when we have a problem,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “With “Five Wishes,” we focus on our needs before the problem arises. During a crisis or when we are unable to speak is not the time to decide how someone wants to be treated – both short and long-term. This program is one of the best at helping us think through some very serious concerns.”
Anyone of any age can attend. No RSVP is required. For more information about the presentations, call the Pierce County Aging and Disability Resource Center at 253-798-4600 or 1-800-562-0332. In case of inclement weather, call 253-798-8787 for possible postponement or cancellation.

Dr. Cline-Parhamovich to join Pierce County as Medical Examiner
 
Karen Cline-Parhamovich, D.O. has accepted the position of Chief Medical Examiner for Pierce County, subject to confirmation by the Pierce County Council.  She is currently Interim State Chief Medical Investigator with the Office of the Medical Investigator (OMI) in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
“I am pleased to welcome this highly skilled forensic pathologist to Pierce County,” said Bruce Dammeier, Pierce County Executive.  “Dr. Cline-Parhamovich’s breadth of experience, strong administrative skill and demonstrated leadership will support the employees of the Medical Examiner’s Office and serve the people of Pierce County who rely on this critical role.”
Cline-Parhamovich has eleven years’ experience as a board-certified forensic pathologist and nine years of leadership experience.  She is also an associate professor of Pathology at the University of New Mexico.
By her own count, she has performed 175 – 220 autopsies annually, in addition to her administrative and teaching responsibilities. 
In 2018, Dr. Cline-Parhamovich organized and led the response to a mass fatality accident which resulted in 8 positive scientific identifications and 7 next-of-kin notifications within 24 to 48 hours of the incident.
Prior to her work in New Mexico, Dr. Cline-Parhamovich was the State Chief Medical Examiner in Tennessee. During that same time, she served as the Director of the Division of Forensic Pathology at East Tennessee State University Quillen College of Medicine.

School funding increases Pierce County property taxes
 
There’s no sugar-coating it, property tax bills will be bigger this year. Taxes on the average home will rise by 4% to 9% in Puyallup, Edgewood, Steilacoom and DuPont. And they’re the lucky ones. 
The rest of Pierce County will see double-digit increases, with the highest around 20% in Lakewood, University Place, Parkland-Spanaway and Fircrest. Tacoma and Gig Harbor taxes will each go up an average of 14%.
County Assessor-Treasurer Mike Lonergan explains that the sharp increase is primarily a result of two factors: actions by the state Legislature in its continued response to the McCleary school funding case and votes by local citizens to increase tax rates in various districts.
“The Legislature’s previous limit of $1.50 per thousand dollars of property value on local school enrichment levies was increased to $2.50,” Lonergan explained, “and a 30-cent reduction in the state school levy has expired. So that’s a $1.30 per thousand increase to start with.”
In addition to these legislative actions, voters in the Bethel, Peninsula and Yelm school districts and the city of Fircrest passed capital bond issues taking effect in 2020, and six fire districts have voter-approved levies or lid lifts starting this year.
“While our assessed values continue to rise, that’s not what drives these big increases,” Lonergan added. “Over 58% of the taxes I collect go to K-12 school funding, so the voted changes there make a huge difference.”
Without a ballot issue, the property tax revenue of a taxing district such as a city or the County can only go up 1% each year, plus the tax resulting from new construction. In fact, most property tax bills in Pierce County actually decreased in 2019. This year’s increase erases that reduction and takes them higher than previous (2018) levels.
Property owners who pay their taxes directly should look for a statement in the mail in mid-February. Those whose taxes are paid out of mortgage accounts may look up their taxes online at 
piercecountywa.gov/atr
 beginning Feb. 1. The first half payment is due no later than April 30, with the balance due by Nov. 2.
One other change this year is that the maximum household income to qualify for a low-income senior or disabled exemption has increased to $45,708. An application form is available on the Assessor-Treasurer’s website or at the Pierce County Annex, 2401 S. 35th St. in Tacoma.

Tips for caregiving on the Alzheimer’s journey
 
Almost 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s today. Researchers worldwide are scrambling to find a cure for Alzheimer’s and other dementias because in 30 years, that number is expected to rise to 14 million.
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources is reintroducing the popular series 
“Oh My Gosh – Now What?”
 beginning Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2020. The series will consist of six discussions designed for individuals with Alzheimer’s or another dementia, families, caregivers and others focusing on the initial journey of memory loss. Each one-hour session will be held on Tuesday evenings at 6 p.m. at the Pierce County Soundview Building, located at 3602 Pacific Ave. in Tacoma. People can attend any or all the discussions.
Sessions will be held six times in the following months:
Feb. 4 – What is Dementia? What are the warning signs?
Feb. 11 – How does the disease progress? What should I expect? 
Feb. 25 – How do I start the conversation? How do I cope with the shock?
March 3 – What are the typical moods and behaviors? How do I manage them?
March 10 – How do I pay for care? What are the legal things I should do?
March 17 – Where can I turn for help? What are the resources I can rely on?
“We all value our memories,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, manager of Aging and Disability Resources.  “In fact, 82% of seniors say it’s important to have their thinking or memory checked.  But only 16% say they receive regular cognitive assessments.  That puts an enormous burden on spouses, families and friends to watch for the tell-tail signs of confusion and/or memory loss.”
“Oh My Gosh – Now What?” is sponsored by the 
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resource Center
. Sessions are informational only and will be led by Kris Sawyers-Dowling and Jessica Girard, case managers with Aging and Disability Resources who specialize in providing practical help to individuals and families coping with memory loss. All presentations are free and open to the public. No RSVP is required. For more information about the presentations, call the Pierce County Aging and Disability Resource Center at 253-798-4600 or 1-800-562-0332.

The Constitution of the State of Washington states that vacancies which occur in the house of the legislature shall be filled by appointment by the county legislative authority of the county in which the vacancy occurs. The person appointed to fill the vacancy must be from the same legislative district and the same political party as the legislator whose office has been vacated. The 30th Legislative District includes areas in both King and Pierce Counties.

Get the most out of your doctor visit
 
In the fast-paced world we live in, it can be difficult to feel heard at healthcare appointments. These appointments can move quickly, so having a second set of eyes and ears can be crucial to good follow-through. When it comes to your health, it’s important for patients and caregivers to be active participants in their care conversations.
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources
, in collaboration with the National Institute on Aging, is proud to offer “Talking with your Doctor,” a presentation focusing on the philosophy guiding the medical community today. This free, research-based presentation will review expectations that providers have for their patients, and how preparing for medical appointments is more important than ever.
The presentation will be offered three times in January:
Jan. 13 – 12:10 p.m., Pierce County Annex, 2401 S. 35
th
, Tacoma
Jan. 13 – 6:30 p.m., Gig Harbor Library, 4424 Pt. Fosdick Dr., Gig Harbor
Jan. 15 – 6:30 p.m., Parkland/Spanaway Library, 13718 Pacific Ave. S., Tacoma
Attendees will be provided with special tools to help make the most of their healthcare visits, such as a preparation form, medication tracker, tip sheets, local resources and a symptom guide. The information in the presentation comes from the National Institute on Aging, a federal agency that is part of the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services.
“Most clinicians are under a significant time crunch,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “They can only spend a limited amount of time with each patient. If a patient has not prepared adequately for their visit it could be time wasted for everyone. Knowing exactly how to describe symptoms, the context for an issue and preparing with questions makes a world of difference.”
“Talking with Your Doctor” is free and open to the public. Anyone of any age can attend and no RSVP is required. For more information about the presentations, call the Pierce County Aging and Disability Resource Center at 253-798-4600 or 800-562-0332. In case of inclement weather, call 253-798-8787 for an updated schedule.

Volunteers, donations needed for the upcoming Homeless Point-In-Time Count
 
Every day in Pierce County, hundreds of people sleep in cars, shelters, or on the street. They are someone’s mom, dad, child, or friend. Do you ever wonder how they lost everything and became homeless? Or how many people in your community are in a similar situation? We answer these questions, and many more, every year through the 
Point-In-Time (PIT) Count.
Pierce County Human Services is 
recruiting volunteers
 to conduct interviews with individuals and families during the Point-In-Time Count on Friday, Jan. 24. Volunteers must 
register online
, be over 18 years old, have access to a smart phone, and commit to attend a training session. 
"We use the PIT Count to help us better understand how we can help our neighbors in crisis,” said Heather Moss, Pierce County Human Services. “Our goal is to ensure that homelessness is rare, brief, and one-time. We are thankful to the many volunteers that help us through this effort.”
There are six upcoming volunteer training opportunities:
Jan. 6 – 1 to 3 p.m., Pierce County Administrative Center and Library, 3005 112th St. E. in Tacoma
Jan. 8 – 5 to 7 p.m., Pierce County Soundview Building, 3602 Pacific Ave. in Tacoma
Jan. 10 – 9 to 11 a.m., Pierce County Soundview Building, 3602 Pacific Ave. in Tacoma
Jan. 13 – 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., Pierce County Soundview Building, 3602 Pacific Ave. in Tacoma
Jan. 14 – 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., Key Center Library, 8905 Key Peninsula Hwy. NW. in Lakebay
Jan. 16 – 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., Bonney Lake Justice Center, 9002 Main St. E. in Bonney Lake
Even if you can’t volunteer, you can still help by donating items such as socks, blankets, hygiene kits, first aid kits, hand warmers, and packaged food like granola bars or bottled water. Donations are given out to anyone experiencing homelessness and provide a positive way to start a conversation. 
Donations can be dropped off through Thurs., Jan. 23 at multiple locations:
Any 
Pierce County Library
Any 
Tacoma Public Library
Lakewood Community Center, 9112 Lakewood Dr. SW. in Lakewood
Tillicum/Woodbrook Community Center, 14916 Washington Ave. SW. in Lakewood
Mountain View Community Center, 3607 122nd Ave. E. Suite A in Edgewood
Share and Care House, 702 23rd Ave. SE. in Puyallup
Vadis, 1701 Elm St. E. in Sumner
Comprehensive Life Resources, 1305 Tacoma Ave. S. Suite 305 in Tacoma
During the Point-In-Time Count, human service professionals and volunteers across the U.S. survey people experiencing homelessness. The data is analyzed and used by communities to plan thoughtful programs and track trends over time. 
Last year, volunteers identified 629 persons sleeping unsheltered outdoors, in cars, or in abandoned buildings—a decrease of 16% from 2018.  In addition, 857 people were sheltered in emergency shelters or transitional housing units. Most of them lived in Pierce County before experiencing homelessness, showing that it is a crisis anyone can face.

New Pierce County Medical Examiner selected
 
Following a nationwide search, Dr. Mark A. Fajardo has been selected Pierce County’s Medical Examiner, pending confirmation by the Pierce County Council.
Dr. Fajardo, currently the Chief Forensic Pathologist for the Riverside County Sheriff Coroner in Calif., has practiced forensic pathology for twenty years. Prior to his position at Riverside County, Fajardo spent three years as the Chief Medical Examiner at Los Angeles County.
“I’m delighted to welcome Dr. Fajardo to Pierce County,” said Executive Bruce Dammeier.  “He brings an impressive combination of technical skill, a collaborative nature and strong administrative experience to his new role.”  
Dammeier added that he was grateful to Carol Mitchell, Senior Counsel for Justice Services, and Peter Asai, Recruitment Manager for Human Resources, for their dedication to sourcing and finding candidates in a very competitive market. “Carol and Peter personally crisscrossed the U.S. and brought an innovative and effective approach to recruitment rarely seen in this field.”
By his own count, Dr. Fajardo has performed more than 6,500 autopsies, including more than 400 homicide cases.  He has provided expert testimony in many civil, federal and criminal cases.
“I know the effort and diligence that was given to the recruitment, and I hope that I live up to the people's expectations and that I serve Pierce County to the best of my ability,” said Fajardo. “I look forward to the challenge of providing timely, accurate death investigation that serves the public with compassion and respect.”
Dr. Fajardo, board certified by the American Board of Pathology, earned his M.D. from UC Davis Medical School and is a Fellow of the National Association of Medical Examiners.  He also serves as a board member of the California State Coroners Association.
Fajardo is a Los Angeles native and will relocate to Pierce County in early 2020.

Local elected officials working to elevate the will of Pierce County voters
 
Pierce County leaders are coming together to help ensure the voice of Pierce County voters is heard in the litigation surrounding the passage of Initiative 976.
Executive Bruce Dammeier has requested Prosecutor Mary Robnett begin preliminary research and background work on Pierce County potentially intervening in the King County Superior Court litigation. By doing so, Pierce County would offer support, assistance and resources to the state Attorney General’s Office as it defends I-976.
“We have heard the voters of Pierce County,” said County Executive Bruce Dammeier.  “As people elected to serve our residents, we believe it is our responsibility to do all that we can to make sure their opinions have impact and influence in this matter before the court.”
There is a limited window of time to impact the litigation proceedings, making the need to act swiftly even more critical.
The Pierce County Council will formally consider the matter at the Dec. 10 Council meeting.
Council Chair Doug Richardson said, “I look forward to considering the request to intervene with my Council colleagues next week.”

Pierce County to continue mobile voting after successful military pilot
 
In support of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) and the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment (MOVE) Act, Pierce County Elections successfully piloted an expansion of electronic balloting in the November 2019 General Election. 
The driving force behind the pilot was the threat of a United States withdrawal from the Universal Postal Union. The Universal Postal Union is a United Nations agency that facilitates postal services between 192 member countries. The withdrawal would have disrupted international postal services and required alternative arrangements for UOCAVA to receive or return of balloting materials. 
To comply with the MOVE Act, Pierce County ballots had to be mailed to UOCAVA voters by Sept. 21, 2019. The fate of the Universal Postal Union was to be decided Sept. 24-25, 2019.  If a resolution wasn’t reached, the U.S. would withdraw from the Union on Oct. 17, 2019. 
“The imminent withdrawal from the Postal Union created an imperative. Knowing that the biggest barrier for military voters is the transit time to receive and return a ballot, we weren’t willing to risk additional delays,” said Pierce County Auditor Julie Anderson, responsible for elections. 
Voatz, a mobile elections platform, was used in the pilot. Eligible registered voters received, marked, verified and submitted their ballots using their personal Apple or Android smartphones. Votes were submitted from 28 countries over the Internet; blockchain technology was used to secure the aggregate vote. 
Voatz uses blockchain technology to store encrypted voting data distributed across 32 U.S. based servers managed equally by Amazon and Microsoft. The voting data is anonymized with an unidentifiable ID number for each ballot and receipt. The process disaggregates any information that could be used to trace its source and votes cast are tamper-proof.
Pierce County’s 19,000 UOCAVA voters are normally permitted to return their ballots by mail, fax, or email attachment. The pilot provided UOCAVA voters a fourth option: Download the Voatz mobile app and transmit a ballot using their mobile device over the Internet and immutably stored on the blockchain.  
Without any prompting, voters used the mobile voting option at a higher rate than fax or email.  In the November 2019 General Election, 103 UOCAVA voters used FAX or email and 163 voters used the mobile voting option. Mail, as usual, was the primary method of ballot returns (2,481 ballots returned by postal service). 
Facsimile and email alternatives are substandard, according to Anderson. Ballots returned by facsimile are often missing important pages and aren’t machine-readable. Ballots and declarations returned as email attachments present significant cybersecurity risks and arrive in a wide-variety of formats ranging from pictures of ballots lying on the floor to pixelated low resolution images.  
Anderson went on to say, “If we want every UOCAVA ballot to be counted accurately and privately, and we want to mitigate the risks of mail disruption, we need a different transmission solution. A secure mobile app that uses encryption to transmit voter-verified ballots is long overdue and desperately needed in an age of global conflict, severe weather events, and international trade disputes.”  
“Pierce County had an excellent experience with the Voatz pilot. We intend to continue offering mobile voting as an option for overseas voters. Pierce County sees this as a safe and secure alternative for UOCAVA voters.  We also see future potential for voters with disabilities– especially those who are blind or have difficulty handling paper and pens.  A secure mobile voting app could be an important accommodation,” said Anderson.
Voatz CEO and Co-Founder Nimit Sawhney was pleased with the pilot. "We’ve been thrilled to partner with Pierce County to extend our mobile voting platform to Pierce’s voters. We look forward to the future of this technology, which we hope can continue to be part of the movement of making our elections as equipped, ready and resilient for the future,” said Mr. Sawhney.
The November 2019 pilot received financial assistance from the National Cybersecurity Center, supported by Tusk Philanthropies.
Pierce County has issued a request for proposals for a mobile voting solution and expects to have a paid vendor under contract in time for Washington State’s March 10, 2020 Presidential Primary. 
About Pierce County Elections
A division of the Pierce County Auditor’s Office, Pierce County Elections has the largest UOCAVA population in Washington State and is a leader in election innovation, resilience, and access. Pierce County is Washington State’s second largest county and has 520,000 active registered voters, of which 19,000 are UOCAVA voters. Washington State has used Vote by Mail exclusively since 2011 and recently adopted Same Day Registration. 
About Voatz
Voatz is an award-winning mobile elections platform that uses biometrics and a blockchain-based infrastructure via compatible smartphones and tablets. Since 2016, Voatz has run numerous elections with towns, cities, states, both major state political parties, universities, and unions. In 2018, in partnership with the State of West Virginia, Voatz ran the first mobile blockchain vote for UOCAVA voters in a federal election. In 2019, the City and County of Denver, Utah County, and two counties in Oregon (Jackson and Umatilla) also selected Voatz to enable UOCAVA citizens to vote in their municipal general and runoff elections.

Images of Aging film embraces diversity and acceptance
 
Life can be cruel. Life can be rewarding. These two realities collide in the next screening of Images of Aging, a free film series raising awareness for the Family Caregiver Support Program.
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources continues this film series with “The Upside,” a 2017 comedy-drama inspired by the real-life experience of Frenchman Philippe Pozzo di Borgo.

“In many ways ‘The Upside’ is a film about how we deal with the challenges life presents to us,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “Each of us can overcome those obstacles by making the best use of our individual support networks. Sometimes those networks are natural, such as families and friends, while other times they can be through accidental acquaintances.”

Images of Aging
. Each film in this series is free and open to the public.  All seats are general admission. Tickets are available one month prior to showing and must be obtained online in advance.

Pierce County to celebrate 10 newly expanded families on Adoption Day
 
Nov. 22 will be a special day at Pierce County Juvenile Court, as 14 children will be formerly adopted into 10 families, in recognition of National Adoption Day. 
“To date, Juvenile Court has celebrated the adoption of 340 children into forever homes. This would not be possible without the loving families in our community who have opened their hearts to children who are in need of a permanent home,” said TJ Bohl, Juvenile Court administrator.
National Adoption Day was founded in 2000 to raise awareness of the thousands of foster children and youth awaiting adoption in the United States. In Washington, more than 9,200 children are currently in foster care and nearly 1,800 of them are legally free, meaning the legal rights of the biological parents have been terminated or relinquished, and are waiting for families to adopt them. In Pierce County, about 1,700 children are in foster care and 185 are legally free.   
The statewide National Adoption Day recognition has grown from an original six counties in 2005 to 
22 counties hosting or joining
 in events to honor adoption. Along with Pierce County, participating counties include Chelan/Douglas, Clallam, Clark, Cowlitz, Ferry, Grant, Grays Harbor, Island, King, Kitsap, Lewis, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skagit, Snohomish, Spokane, Stevens, Thurston, Whatcom, and Yakima.

Golden Given Road E and 104th Street E intersection to change to all-way stop in early November
 
The Golden Given Road East and 104th Street East intersection will be converted to an all-way stop starting Nov. 7 to enhance safety at the intersection.
The schedule for this change is weather dependent. Please visit 
www.piercecountywa.gov/trafficprojects
 for schedule updates.
The intersection, which is located west of Ford Middle School, currently has stop signs for the westbound and eastbound directions of 104th Street East.
The new stop signs on southbound and northbound Golden Given Road East will include flashing beacons alerting motorists to the stop signs.
Motorists traveling southbound and northbound on Golden Given Road East should expect some additional delay during peak periods in the mornings and evenings due to the new stop requirements.
A July 2018 traffic study determined a traffic signal or roundabout is needed at the intersection due to traffic volume and collision history. The intersection’s conversion to an all-way stop is being made as an interim measure while a project is developed and funding is procured.

Images of Aging explores personal prejudices and social changes
 
For an older adult, the decision to stop driving is never an easy one. Driving is the hallmark of personal independence and a symbol of individual freedom. In many cases, there are health issues involved that make driving dangerous, so the choice to stop may be more challenging.
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources continues the Images of Aging film series with a free screening of “Driving Miss Daisy.” The movie will be shown on Nov. 9, at the Grand Cinema, located at 606 Fawcett Ave. in Tacoma. Doors open at 10:30 a.m. and the film begins at 10:45 a.m. Tickets are free but must be obtained in advance 
online
 or by calling the Aging and Disability Resource Center at 253-798-4600.
“Driving Miss Daisy” uses driving to explore deeper issues of prejudice, friendship and change. The PG-rated film focuses on an older Jewish woman set in the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant-dominated Southern society of the 1960s and a willful African-American chauffeur. Over the years their relationship grows from contentious to something much more profound.
Reviews by film critic Robert Ebert state “It is an immensely subtle film, in which hardly any of the most important information is carried in the dialogue and in which body language, tone of voice or the look in an eye can be the most important thing in a scene. After so many movies in which shallow and violent people deny their humanity and ours, what a lesson to see a film that looks into the heart.”
“Time and again we hear the adage that it’s never too late,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “Whether its careers, hobbies, friendships, adventures or relationships, we are encouraged to broaden our horizons and try something new.  This film shows how two people deal with change, embrace differences and develop a lasting friendship.”
Images of Aging
 film screenings are held on the second Saturday of the month in partnership with the Grand Cinema in Tacoma. Each film is free and open to the public. All seats are general admission.  For more information about the films call the Pierce County 
Aging and Disability Resource Center
 at 253-798-4600 or 800-562-0332.

Pierce County road crews prepare for winter weather
 
Pierce County is preparing now for snow and ice on county roads.
Road crews will set up and calibrate snow-fighting equipment and travel their snow plow routes on Oct. 31. Over the rest of the week, they will review snow and ice response plans, practice operating equipment and brush up on chainsaw techniques.
“Our road crews will be ready to respond to snow and ice on Pierce County roads this winter,” said Bruce Wagner, Pierce County Planning and Public Works maintenance and operations manager. “Residents can prepare by making sure their car is in good working condition and putting together an emergency kit for their car that includes blankets, a flashlight, warm clothes and non-perishable food.”  
Residents can find suggestions for creating an emergency kit for vehicles at 
www.piercecountywa.org/winterwise
.  
About Pierce County’s snow and ice response
Pierce County maintains approximately 3,260 lane miles of roadway in unincorporated Pierce County. Approximately 1,640 lane miles are identified as key arterials that connect residential areas to service centers and state highways. The level of service these roads receive during winter weather is determined by several factors, including weather conditions, the classification of the roadway, and available resources. 
“Our priorities during a snow and ice event are key arterials, as well as Pierce Transit and school bus snow routes,” Wagner said. “If you can get out of your neighborhood and reach a major road during a snow and ice event, you will likely find a drivable road.”
When a severe winter storm is forecast, Pierce County’s plan calls for crews to apply anti-icing products to key arterials. If heavy snowfall affects roads countywide, plow trucks with de-icing materials are deployed 24-hours a day when all resources are available until conditions improve. 
The public can reach the Pierce County Planning and Public Works Maintenance and Operations Division 24-hours a day at 253-798-6000 with requests for service. They can also fill out a Request for Action form at 
www.piercecountywa.org/rfa
.
Visit 
www.piercecountywa.org/winterwise
 to learn more about Pierce County’s response to winter weather.
Media Advisory: Media invited to Oct. 31 snow and ice presentation and tour
Media outlets are invited to a presentation about Pierce County’s snow and ice response at 9 a.m. Oct. 31 at the Pierce County Central Maintenance Facility, 4812 196th St. E in Spanaway. 
After the presentation, the media will be taken on a tour to the different equipment stations to get footage of crews hooking up snow plows, testing the application rates of anti-icing products, and practicing plowing using wood chips.
Please RSVP by 3 p.m. Oct. 30 to Anne Radford, Planning and Public Works public information specialist, at 253-798-2464 or 
anne.radford@piercecountywa.gov
. On Oct. 31, media outlets may call the Maintenance and Operation Division at 253-798-6000 for assistance.

Film focuses on early onset dementia
 
When you think of Alzheimer’s or dementia, you probably think of an older adult. Contrary to popular belief, early onset Alzheimer’s affects people younger than age 65. They have families, careers or may even be caregivers to someone else when the disease strikes. Up to 5 percent of the more than 5 million Americans with Alzheimer’s have younger onset.
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources is partnering with the Pierce County Library System to offer “Too Soon to Forget,” a powerful series including a documentary and follow-up discussion. There is no RSVP required. Six free screenings will be held in November:
Nov. 4 - 12:30 p.m., Lakewood Branch Library, 6300 Wildaire Road in Lakewood    
Nov. 5 - 6:30 p.m., Pierce County Soundview Building, 3602 Pacific Ave., in Tacoma    
Nov. 6 - 5:30 p.m., Key Center Branch Library, 8905 Key Peninsula Highway NW., in Lakebay
Nov. 8 - 1 p.m., South Hill Branch Library, 15420 Meridian E., in South Hill
Nov. 9 - 11 a.m., Parkland/Spanaway Branch Library, 13718 Pacific Ave. S., in Tacoma
Nov. 13 - 6:30 p.m., University Place Branch Library, 3609 Market Place W., in University Place
Getting an accurate diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's can be a long and frustrating process. Healthcare providers generally don't look for Alzheimer's disease in younger people and symptoms may be incorrectly attributed to stress or other factors. Although there are many resources for those coping with Alzheimer's, very little information is available specifically for those facing younger-onset. This lack of information and support leaves many families feeling misunderstood and often disregarded. 
“November is Alzheimer’s Awareness Month,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “It is an opportune time for us to learn more about Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia and how the symptoms manifest themselves. For the sake of the individual as well as the family, the importance of recognizing the symptoms and pursuing appropriate medical advice cannot be stressed enough.”
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources helps families caring for loved ones with case management, education and connection to supportive services, resources and programs. To learn more about these services contact the

Reduce flooding by keeping storm drains clear of leaves
 
Pierce County residents can help reduce roadway flooding by keeping storm drains free of leaves.
“The potential for roadway flooding increases if storm drains are clogged by leaves during rainy weather,” said Dennis Hanberg, Pierce County Planning and Public Works director. “Residents can help reduce roadway flooding by picking up yard waste and regularly checking storm drains near their property to make sure they are clear of leaves.”
Pierce County residents can take the following actions to keep storm drains clear:
Put leaves and other yard debris in yard waste bins for pick up. Find transfer stations where you can drop off yard waste at 
www.piercecountywa.gov/yardwaste
.
If it can be done safely, remove leaves from storm drains with a rake.
For Pierce County roadways: If a blockage can’t be cleared, the roadway is flooding or a storm drain is on a busy road, call Pierce County Planning and Public Works at 253-798-6000 or submit a Request for Action at 
www.piercecountywa.gov/rfa
.
Call 253-798-6000 to report flooding along a stream, river or pond in unincorporated Pierce County. 
Residents in cities and towns should contact their local public works department to report flooding or storm drain problems.
Roadway flooding response
Significant rainstorms may cause roadside storm drains and ditches to overflow and flood the roadway. River flooding may also affect roads. As the rain saturates the ground, there is also an increased risk of downed trees and landslides.
Pierce County crews clear drainage systems, downed trees and landslides when possible, close roads or lanes if they are not passable, and clean drainage systems proactively to reduce flooding.
Motorists should not drive through standing water, near downed trees or utility lines, or around road closure barricades.
River flooding
Flooding is the most common disaster in the United States and Pierce County is not an exception. With four major rivers in the county, flooding is a possibility each winter. While Pierce County spends between $3-$4 million annually on maintenance to levees along those rivers, flooding is not limited to communities and areas next to rivers. 
Coastal flooding
Coastal flooding also occurs in Pierce County. This type of flooding is caused either by wind-driven waves or a storm surge pushing water onto shore. Residents along the county’s coast should secure items that are outside to prevent them from being moved during flooding and damaging property or hurting people. 
“People need to have a plan in case there is flooding around their home or where they work,” Hanberg said. “And, when there is a major storm, residents should monitor Pierce County’s website and media outlets for updates.”
Residents can prepare for flooding by learning the flood risk to their property. Pierce County can help with a free map of a property that explains flood risk. Also, flood insurance is available to all homeowners and renters in unincorporated Pierce County. Residents in unincorporated Pierce County receive a 40% discount on their flood insurance policies. Homeowners insurance does not cover losses from flooding.
To learn about flood risk to your property and preparing for flooding, go to

Learn what’s on the horizon for Social Security in 2020
 
Since 1935, Social Security has been the cornerstone of retirement plans for most Americans. The program continues to evolve, responding to the challenges of each generation. For individuals preparing to start their Social Security benefits, current and future changes may impact their retirement plans. A few simple tips and knowledge in advance may save thousands of dollars.
“Social Security Retirement 2020” is a fast-paced presentation for those currently receiving benefits or who are anticipating their benefits in the year ahead. This free informational workshop will be presented from 4-5:30 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 21 at Brookdale Allenmore Independent Living, located at 2010 S. Union Ave. in Tacoma. Refreshments will be provided.
Attendees will learn strategies to maximize benefits including when to begin receiving them and the advantages of making claims based on spousal work history. Participants will also learn how to negotiate the rules about working, either full or part time, while receiving benefits. One of the best ways to understand benefits is by opening and using your 
mySocial Security Online Account
. Before attending the class please open an account, printout, and bring your Social Security Statement. If you need assistance setting up your account, Kirk Larson will be available to help after the presentation.
The presentation will be given by Kirk Larson, Western Washington Public Affairs Specialist for the Social Security Administration. He has worked with the agency for over 25 years in both technical and supervisory roles. Kirk has presented Social Security information throughout the west coast and has appeared on numerous TV and radio shows to discuss Social Security issues.
“Nine out of ten Americans 65 and older receive Social Security benefits,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “Most estimates say 21% of married couples and 44% of single seniors rely on Social Security for 90% or more of their income.  Regardless of current income, shifting to Social Security – in whole or in part – is an important step.  Planning how to make the most of the Social Security benefit is crucial.”
“Social Security 2020” is hosted by Brookdale Allenmore and sponsored by the Pierce County Human Services 
Aging and Disability Resource Center
 and Social Security Administration. The presentation is free, and no RSVP is required. For more information, contact the Aging & Disability Resource Center at 253-798-4600 or 800-562-0332.

Film explores challenges of aging in place
 
Over 75% of Americans aged 50 and older would prefer to stay at home as they age. When aging in place, the underlying goal is to live in the residence of their choice for as long as they can. But there is much more to staying safe at home than meets the eye.
The Images of Aging film series, sponsored by Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources, is offering a free screening of “5 Flights Up.” The movie will be shown on Oct. 12, at the Grand Cinema, located at 606 S. Fawcett Ave. in Tacoma. Doors open at 10:30 a.m. and the film begins at 10:45 a.m. Tickets are free but must be obtained in advance 
online
 or by calling the Aging and Disability Resource Center at 253-798-4600.
“5 Flights Up” is a 2015 comedy-drama starring award-winning actors Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton as a happily married couple. After forty years living in the same apartment, they decide to move into a place that is easier to manage, resulting in a soul-searching journey. The film is an exploration into the multitude of concerns, values and dynamics of family that can raise complex questions about life as we age.
“A home is much more than just a place to live,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “Over time it becomes filled with history, memories, and stories.  As the years go by, health changes, neighborhoods evolve and our abilities lessen. Inevitably, we start asking about where we should live. But the answers are not always clean cut.”
Every film in the Images of Aging series is free and open to the public. All seats are general admission and given on a first come, first serve basis. Tickets are available one month prior to showing and must be obtained online in advance. For more information about the films call the 
Pierce County Aging and Disability Resource Center
 at 253-798-4600 or 800-562-0332.

Outdoor improvements coming to Sprinker Recreation Center
 
Sprinker Recreation Center
, a versatile regional sports complex located in the Parkland-Spanaway area, home to countless baseball and soccer tournaments, western Washington’s largest outdoor skatepark, mountain climbing rock, and many other amenities, is scheduled for outdoor improvements.
Pierce County Parks is seeking public input this fall and winter to determine a final project plan for these outdoor improvements with construction anticipated to begin in 2022.
Following a public process in 2016 and 2017, the Parks Board adopted a Master Plan for Sprinker Recreation Center which includes outdoor improvements. Some ideas include a spray park, new multi-purpose athletic fields, expanded playground, picnic areas and accessible walking trails.
To help fund this project, Pierce County Parks will apply for a Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office grant in 2020. Anticipated construction would begin in 2022 or 2023.
Three opportunities for public input are scheduled to continue the conversation on outdoor improvement concepts. The first will be on Tuesday, Oct. 8 from 6 to 8 p.m. in the Alder Room at Sprinker Recreation Center, located at 14824 C St. S. in Tacoma (

). The goal of these meetings will be to gather input from park users to refine designs for the outdoor improvements.
Drop by Sprinker Recreation Center on Oct. 8 to learn about the design choices and share your thoughts. Bring the family. Snacks and activities will be provided for kids. If you cannot attend this meeting, you will have the opportunity to 
share your ideas online
 Oct. 8-31. 
You can find a schedule for future events and sign up for email updates at the 
project website

Pierce County approved to move to Phase 2 of Safe Start order
Pierce County learned today the county’s application to move to Phase 2 was approved by the state Department of Health. The move to the second phase is effective immediately.
“I’m pleased that our residents’ hard work to social distance and abide by best practices has been recognized,” said Executive Bruce Dammeier.  “While we are eager to see some of the restrictions lifted, I urge our community to continue with the practices that protect themselves, their families and our community.”
Activities allowed under Phase 2, with certain restrictions, include restaurants at 50% capacity, in-store retail at 30% capacity and the re-opening of salons, barbers and other personal grooming services.
The County is expected to remain in Phase 2 for at least three weeks and can apply to move to the next phase when prescribed COVID-19 targets have been achieved.
“We’ve spent this week handing out a million masks to our local businesses, nonprofits and houses of worship for just this day,” said Council Chair Doug Richardson. “It’s great to know that they will have the PPE they need in time to safely re-open.”
More information about what is allowed under Phase 2 may be found at governor.wa.gov.
