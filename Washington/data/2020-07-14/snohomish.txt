Mental Health and Coping During COVID-19
 The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be stressful for people and communities. Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Liza Patchen-Short, the Snohomish County Children’s Mental Health Liaison with Human Services Behavioral Health, recommends following guidance from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).




 Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations. 
 The emotional impact of an emergency on a person can depend on the person’s characteristics and experiences, the social and economic circumstances of the person and their community, and the availability of local resources. People can become more distressed if they see repeated images or hear repeated reports about the outbreak in the media.People who may respond more strongly to the stress of a crisis include:Additional information and resources on mental health care can be found at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

 Children react, in part, on what they see from the adults around them. When parents and caregivers deal with the COVID-19 calmly and confidently, they can provide the best support for their children. Parents can be more reassuring to others around them, especially children, if they are better prepared.Not all children respond to stress in the same way.

Some typical reactions after being released from COVID-19 quarantine can include:Children may also feel upset or have other strong emotions if they, or someone they know, has been released from quarantine.

Events and large gatheringsWe are not at the peak of this outbreak. That is why early, comprehensive, and sustained social distancing is critical. We know that this will have impacts on the people of Snohomish County, but we urge you to respect these essential measures. They have been carefully considered with the goal of keeping people safe and healthy.




 Dr. Chris Spitters, interim health officer for the Snohomish Health District,
 issued an order on March 11 that all events with more than 250 people are prohibited in Snohomish County
. Washington Governor Jay Inslee also announced that gatherings of 250 people or more are being prohibited in Snohomish, King, and Pierce counties at least through the end of March.
 Under the order, events with fewer than 250 attendees also are prohibited unless organizers take steps to minimize risk. Those steps include:
 Events that are subject to this order include gatherings for business, social, spiritual, or recreational activities. This does include community, civic, public, faith-based, or sporting events, parades, concerts, festivals, conventions, and fundraisers. It does not include normal school, health care facilities, or other public safety and critical infrastructure operations.



For non-essential smaller events, this is a good time to consider canceling or postponing.



In any event or group situation, the larger the group, the higher the risk. The closer the contact to others, the higher the risk.
 Older adults or people with underlying conditions are encouraged not to attend.Social distancing recommendations are in place. People should avoid being within 6 feet of each other for longer than momentary or minimal contact.Employees are screened for coronavirus symptoms each day and are excluded if symptomatic.Proper hand hygiene and sanitation is readily available to attendees and employees.Environmental cleaning guidelines from the CDC are followed, including more cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces at least daily.
