 – The Benton County Board of Commissioners, at their regular Board meeting May 12, 2020, approved the immediate allocation of an additional $500,000 of existing Homeless Housing Funds toward the Emergency Housing Program, operated by the Benton County Human Services Department.

These additional funds were already existing within the Benton County budget but were not previously allocated for this purpose and have been immediately allocated to assist individuals and families in the community who are facing hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic.




Program Eligibility


To be eligible for assistance, individuals and/or families must meet program income requirements. Funding will be allocated based on priority to individuals and families identified with the highest need.



Screening for program eligibility is conducted by the Human Services Department and occurs on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays during regular business hours, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. In response to COVID-19, these screenings will take place over the phone by calling (509) 737-3946.

About Benton County


Benton County is located in south-central Washington. The county seat is located in Prosser, and its largest city is Kennewick. Benton County was created on March 8, 1905 and was named after U.S. Senator Thomas Hart Benton. Benton County operates under the plural executive form of government with three commissioners and seven other elected officials. Benton County has offices located in Prosser and Kennewick.

Counties may make and enforce local regulations as long as they do not conflict with state law, including the Governor’s recent proclamations related to COVID-19 (
Washington Constitution Article XI, Section 11
). If Benton County were to adopt regulations inconsistent with the Governor’s proclamations it may result in confusion for the citizens and lead to unintended impacts when the State enforces its regulations. 



The County is limited to imposing only those regulations which go above and beyond what the State of Washington has imposed. The County cannot institute laws or proclamations that are less restrictive than those in place by the State. To date, we’ve imposed no such additional measures, and are working with fellow jurisdictions and our State representatives to encourage the State to lift some of the regulations that are currently in place.



While Benton County leaders may not agree with every decision made by the Governor in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognize and respect the authority that people of Washington have granted to the Governor and the representatives they’ve elected to serve them in the State Legislature. 



In the meantime, County offices and departments continue to serve the community as safely as possible, including processing permits, rescheduling events at the Fairgrounds, and keeping our County parks (like Candy Mountain and Badger Mountain Preserves) open for our residents to use.  The County is also actively seeking grant funds to assist the community, including small businesses, in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.



We encourage our community to regularly contact their state representatives and the Governor to voice their concerns so that we can all work together to get our community on the path to recovery.
