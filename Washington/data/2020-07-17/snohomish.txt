Mental Health and Coping During COVID-19
 The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be stressful for people and communities. Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Liza Patchen-Short, the Snohomish County Children’s Mental Health Liaison with Human Services Behavioral Health, recommends following guidance from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).




 Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations. 
 The emotional impact of an emergency on a person can depend on the person’s characteristics and experiences, the social and economic circumstances of the person and their community, and the availability of local resources. People can become more distressed if they see repeated images or hear repeated reports about the outbreak in the media.People who may respond more strongly to the stress of a crisis include:Additional information and resources on mental health care can be found at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA)
 website.Reactions during an infectious disease outbreak can include:
 Coping with these feelings and getting help when you need it will help you, your family, and your community recover from a disaster. Connect with family, friends, and others in your community. Take care of yourself and each other, and know when and how to seek help. 
Call your healthcare provider if stress reactions interfere with your daily activities for several days in a row.

.For parents:
 Children react, in part, on what they see from the adults around them. When parents and caregivers deal with the COVID-19 calmly and confidently, they can provide the best support for their children. Parents can be more reassuring to others around them, especially children, if they are better prepared.Not all children respond to stress in the same way. Some common changes to watch for in children:

 Being separated from others if a health care provider thinks you may have been exposed to COVID-19 can be stressful, even if you do not get sick. Some typical reactions after being released from COVID-19 quarantine can include:Children may also feel upset or have other strong emotions if they, or someone they know, has been released from quarantine.

Gov. Jay Inslee announced mandatory six-week closures for K-12 public and private schools across all 43 School Districts in Snohomish, King, and Pierce counties.

school district website
, or private school website, for the latest information. 




FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

school district website
 for details. Will classes be held online?

 Will sporting events and other extracurricular activities be held? What about state sports tournaments?
 
 Probably not, because gatherings of 250+ people are temporarily prohibited, by order of the health officer. But check with your student’s coach or 
school district website
 for the latest information. 
 How will this effect high school seniors and the credits they are earning toward college? Are proctored college entrance exams still happening? 
 
 Answers to these questions will have to be worked out in coming weeks. Watch for messaging from your school district. Gov. Inslee is encouraging colleges to be flexible regarding admission requirements this year.

 Please check with your 
school district
 regarding its home-school policies and support, and see the state’s

YMCA of Snohomish County
 
or your local 
Boys & Girls Club.

Workplace and Employer Concerns
 Should I go to work? Should I send somebody home?
 From Dr. Chris Spitters, Health Officer:Employees should ensure they are fever-free and asymptomatic before leaving home and reporting for work. If they do not have fever or respiratory symptoms they may report to work. While at work, if they develop fever (measured temperature above 100.0 F or subjective fever) OR respiratory symptoms like a sore throat, cough, or difficulty breathing, they should:Employers in healthcare settings could consider measuring temperature and assessing symptoms prior to starting work. For others, relying on employee reports is acceptable in most settings.Employers are encouraged to maximize
 
telecommuting options for as many employees as possible, but particularly individuals at risk of COVID-19.Additional recommendations to decrease social contacts in the workplace include:immediately self-isolate (separate themselves from others);notify their supervisor;go home and stay home until 7 days after symptom onset or 72 hours after symptoms resolve, whichever is longer; andIf symptoms persist or worsen, call their health care provider for further guidance.Increase physical space between workers and customers at the worksite – 6 feet apartDecrease social contacts in the workplace (limit in-person meetings, break room, cafeteria, and other gatherings)Stagger work schedules, consider alternate team approaches for work schedules.Establish liberal leave and telework policies, 7-day leave policies for people with symptomsCancel non-essential work travel and work-sponsored conferences, tradeshows, etc.

Events and large gatheringsWe are not at the peak of this outbreak. That is why early, comprehensive, and sustained social distancing is critical. We know that this will have impacts on the people of Snohomish County, but we urge you to respect these essential measures. They have been carefully considered with the goal of keeping people safe and healthy.




 Dr. Chris Spitters, interim health officer for the Snohomish Health District,
 issued an order on March 11 that all events with more than 250 people are prohibited in Snohomish County
. Washington Governor Jay Inslee also announced that gatherings of 250 people or more are being prohibited in Snohomish, King, and Pierce counties at least through the end of March.
 Under the order, events with fewer than 250 attendees also are prohibited unless organizers take steps to minimize risk. Those steps include:
 Events that are subject to this order include gatherings for business, social, spiritual, or recreational activities. This does include community, civic, public, faith-based, or sporting events, parades, concerts, festivals, conventions, and fundraisers. It does not include normal school, health care facilities, or other public safety and critical infrastructure operations.



For non-essential smaller events, this is a good time to consider canceling or postponing.



In any event or group situation, the larger the group, the higher the risk. The closer the contact to others, the higher the risk.
 Older adults or people with underlying conditions are encouraged not to attend.Social distancing recommendations are in place. People should avoid being within 6 feet of each other for longer than momentary or minimal contact.Employees are screened for coronavirus symptoms each day and are excluded if symptomatic.Proper hand hygiene and sanitation is readily available to attendees and employees.Environmental cleaning guidelines from the CDC are followed, including more cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces at least daily.

-19. These proposed grant programs 
would be part of the relief and recovery actions Snohom
ish County is taking to help businesses impacted 
by the pandemic.
   ﬁBusinesses are facing a critical moment in the COVID
-19 pandemic,ﬂ said Executive Somers. ﬁWhile some 
have been able to secure assistance from federal and state governments, not all have.
 Many of our local 
businesses need more. These grant programs would provide a direct injection of funds to help those most 
in need now. We are doing everything that we can to help keep employees paid and businesses viable. 
Small businesses are the backbone
 of our local economy. These resources would serve as a critical lifeline 
to many in the community who are on the frontlines of preserving and rebuilding our economy.ﬂ

apply for most businesses.
  It is also anticipated 
awards will made within five weeks of the application.

previously known energy use over time. For small businesses experiencing 
reduced hours or lower productivity, this may result in a bill credit.

resulted in higher energy use. This can include the extended use of lights, 
televisions, appliances, computers and electric heating or air conditioning. 
As a result, residential customer b
ills may be higher than expected. Any 
customer who needs assistance paying a PUD bill may contact Customer 
Service at (425) 783

Meter readers returning to 
the field will follow strict social distancing 
guidelines for their safety and the safety of PUD customers, who are asked 
to please refrain from close contact. If meter readers feel unsafe for any 
reason, they have the authority to not read a meter, which 
would result in 
an estimated bill. Customers who believe their bill does not closely reflect

Widespread Testing Within Long Term Care Facilities
 
Supply sh

thousands of staffers and residents at long term care facilities across the 

equipment and return shipment materials, 
to be sent in waves every three 
days to ensure labs have the capacity to process all of the samples.
 
On May 29, the Washington State Department of Health (DOH)
 
issued an 
order
 
that requires wide
spread testing within long term care facilities. 
Residents and staff in nursing homes will be tested within approximately 
two weeks, with a completion goal date of June 12. All residents and staff 
in assisted living facilities with a memory care unit will 
be tested within four 
weeks, with a completion goal date of June 26.
 


settings are a priority for us and we are work
ing with local health 
jurisdictions, facilities and health system partners to understand the 
challenges associated with expanded testing and mobilizing the resources 

 
Nursing home and other long term car
e residents are at high risk for 
infection, serious illness and death from COVID
-
19, and testing, along with 
other infection prevention and control measures, is a critical tool to identify 
cases and stop transmission. Once test results are received, positi
ve results 
should be reported following normal protocol, and be referred to local 
health jurisdictions for case investigation, contact tracing and 
isolation/quarantine support. If a resident tests positive, DOH recommends 
that the facility follow
 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
guidance
 
on cohorting both residents and staff. Staff who are 
asymptomatic and test positive should not return to work for 10 days (from 
the test day).
 
Federal guidance recommends
 
a baseline universal test for all residents 
and staff before a facility progresses between any phases of reopening.

  Snohomish County Leaders Push to Enter Phase II of Opening
 Action by Board of Health and County Council necessary to advance proposal
  EVERETT, Snohomish County, May 28, 2020
ŠToday,
 Snohomish 
County Executive Dave Somers, Board of 
Health Chair Stephanie Wright,
 and County Council Chair Nate Nehring jointly announced their intention 
for Snohomish County to be moved into Phase 2 of Governor Inslee™s phased reopening plan.
 With 
Wednesday™s approva
l of the final piece of the COVID
-19 response plan by the County Council, 
Snohomish County now has all of the elements necessary to meet Phase II requirements for large 
counties.
  
ﬁSnohomish County residents have paid a heavy price from the COVID
-19 pandem
ic,ﬂ said Executive 
Somers.
  ﬁWe will respond to the pandemic with everything we have and recover as quickly as we can. 
We now must move forward with our request to enter Phase II and help our people safely get back to 

work.ﬂ
  ﬁThe Snohomish Health Distric
t and its partners have succeeded in preserving the health and safety of 
thousands in Snohomish County,ﬂ said Chair Wright. ﬁIt is now time for us to move into Phase II and re
-start our economy. I will be proposing that the Board of Health consider a varia
nce on Friday.ﬂ
   
ﬁIt is critical that Snohomish County moves into Phase 2 so that we can begin to provide economic relief 

to our local businesses, workers, and families who are 
struggling,ﬂ said County Council Chair Nehring. ﬁI 
am proud to join my fellow county leaders in this joint proposal to move us in the right direction and 
support our local economy.ﬂ
  Due to the COVID
-19 package approved Wednesday, Snohomish County now has 
adequate resources 
directed toward PPE, testing, contact tracing, and the isolation and the quarantine facility to meet the 
most important criteria for Phase II.
  Also, Snohomish County believes most hospitals currently have 
sufficient capacity to meet any
 potential surge, and the Health District intends to submit letters from 
each as part of any approved variance proposal. The rate of infection approaches the parameters set by 

the state, if subsets of irregular outbreaks, such as assisted living facilities
, are taken into account, as the 
   Snohomish County
    CDC allows. 
The decision to apply for a variance will need to be approved by the Snohomish Health 
District Board of Health and the Snohomish County Council. Both have called for emergency special 
meetings on Friday in order
 to consider this proposal, and if approved, the package, with a letter from 
the Executive, will be submitted by the Snohomish Health District to the Washington Secretary of Health 
for consideration.
  If Snohomish County is allowed to move to Phase II and 
beyond, it will be important to avoid a spike in 
infections and the likelihood of reverting back to Phase I. COVID
-19 will be a threat for some time, but 
Snohomish County is now better prepared to manage the threat.

19 Updates and Reminders for Snohomish County
 
The number of COVID
-
19 cases continues to increase in Snohomish 
County, as do the impacts on employers and organizations. While the 
Snohomish Health District typically does not release the
 
names of 
businesses associated with confirmed cases, there are occasional 
exceptions based on outbreaks or potential exposure to high
-
risk 
populations. Today there are two such notifications.
 
Child Care Ordered to Close
 

 
to Tender Hearts Day School in 
Marysville. This child care location was closed due to an ongoing outbreak 
of COVID
-
19 among staff and children, and the potential for continued 
transmission.
 
As of today, there are 10 confirmed and four probable cases, 
primarily 
involving children. The Health District is continuing to work with impacted 
staff and families on symptom monitoring, testing status and quarantine 
procedures as needed. The center is currently closed through July 14.
 
In accordance with WAC 246
-
1
01
-
425, employers must be prepared to fully 
and promptly assist the Health District in a communicable disease case or 
outbreak investigation. Employers may be asked to provide the Health 
District with a list of employees or visitors that were onsite within
 
a specific 

readily available and sent immediately, or no more than four hours after 
requested. 
 
Employers should return all calls immediately and prioritize any requests 
made. Id
entifying and contacting all close contacts of a confirmed case 
within 48 hours is a critical piece of being able to quickly contain and stop 
the spread of illness. It is also one of the metrics being reported on a 
weekly basis to the state to monitor the 

Safe Start plan.
 
Temporary Increase at Isolation & Quarantine Site
 

week, results were received yesterday with one positive individual. The 
resident
 
who tested positive has no symptoms and is currently in stable 

abundance of caution for cleaning and sanitizing. 
 
There have been 51 residents temporarily relocated to the isolation 
and 
quarantine facility located at Evergreen State Fairgrounds. All who may 
have come in contact with the positive case will be tested for COVID
-
19 
and monitored. Out of respect for the privacy and security of those ate the 
isolation and quarantine facilit
y, no additional information is available at 
this time.
 
The isolation and quarantine facility was established by Snohomish County 
in April as part of the COVID
-
19 response. Isolating those who are 
considered infectious and quarantining those who have been 
exposed 
and may become infectious has helped to reduce transmission. 
 
Snohomish County is required to provide resources for the safe, temporary 
isolation and quarantine of people who may have been exposed and are 
not able to safely quarantine from the viru
s in their own home, or who are

that provides metrics aligned with the

some data being run mid

Key highlights for the time period from June 18 

 
July 2 include:
 

 
A case rate of 53.3 per 100,000 in a 
14
-
day period, up from 38.5 
per 100,000 from June 10
-
25.
 

 
Average percentage of tests positive for COVID
-
19 is stable 
compared to last week at 5.4%, but is up from its low of 2.3% five 
weeks ago.
 

 
Number of outbreaks involving two or more cases in a 14
-
day 
p
eriod at a workplace, congregate or institutional setting has 
increased from 3 to 5. 
 

 
Additional staff being hired by the Health District has helped 
increase the ability to reach cases and contacts sooner, with the 
number of cases reached within 24 hours i
ncreasing from 32% to 
57%.
 
There have been some questions received on why these updates do not 
match information on the 
Phases and Risk Assessment Dashboard
 
pr
ovided 
by the Washington State Department of Health (DOH). The data online 
change every day when new cases get reported. This is because the 
newly reported cases on any given day have a variety of different 

ated frequently, 

negligible, technical differences that do not affect the information and 
general impression provided by the data. 
 
 
Health District Reminders for Businesses
 
To 
help the Health District quickly identify COVID site supervisors within 
each business location, an online form has been created at 
www.snohd.org/EmployerNotifications
. The Health District is reques
ting that 
all employers in Snohomish County fill out the form, which identifies a 
primary and back

up contacts. Completing this form will also ensure your 
organization is contacted promptly, and through your preferred channels 
of staff appropriately traine
d on what to do when contacted.
 
Additional business guidance was included in

Waiver Extension: WIC 
W
ill Continue to Provide Remote 
Services
 
Congress recently extended waivers that permit Washington WIC to offer 
remote services through September 30. WIC is the 
Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children
. While the rules normally 
require in
-
person meetings, the waivers allow WIC to enroll new applicants, 
provide nutrition education and breastfeeding support, and 
issue food 
benefits by phone or video chat. Since WIC started offering remote 
services, program participation grew by about 4 percent and the rate of 
missed appointments dropped from 15 percent to almost zero.
 
Washington WIC also expanded the list of allow
ed foods to give families 
more choices. Participants now shop for WIC foods using a WIC card, 
which makes shopping easier. The 
WIC Sh
opper App
 
is another new tool 
that helps WIC families pick out the right foods. The app has parenting tips 
and recipes that are great for all young families, not just those on WIC.
 
WIC gives families access to nutritious food and provides health screening,
 
risk assessment, nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and referrals to 
health and social services. The program provides essential services for 
pregnant people, new and breastfeeding moms, infants, and children 
under five. Most pregnant people and y
oung children on Medicaid or 
Basic Food (SNAP) qualify for WIC services.
 
Given layoffs and other economic consequences related to COVID
-
19, 
people may be seeking WIC services for the first time. WIC has capacity 
and welcomes new families. To find WIC servi

DAILY BRIEFING
 
Gov. Inslee 
Announces Changes to Allowed Activities 
Under
 

 
 
Gov. Jay Inslee on Thursday announced changes to health and safety 
restriction in light of increasing COVID
-
19 case rates
 
statewide.
 
 
Effective Monday, July 20, all indoor and outdoor live entertainment is 
prohibited. Also, the cap on social gatherings for any county in Phase 3 will 
be lowered to no more than 10 people. This will apply to counties that 
move into Phase 3 in t
he future. Snohomish County remains in Phase 2 at 
this time, and gatherings are capped at no more than five people from 
outside of your household in a seven
-
day period. 
 
There are some exceptions. Spiritual gatherings, weddings and funerals 
may continue to
 
operate 
under existing guidance
.
 
Reports from public health staff arou
nd the state show that COVID is 
spreading largely through social gatherings, said Inslee and Secretary of 
Health John Wiesman. 
 


 
Statewide, the 7
-
day rolling 
average for cases is up to 629 cases per day. 

 
In particular, cases are rising among a younger demographic. Although 
younger people may not get as ill as those who are older or who have pre
-
e
xisting health condition, they still can become severely ill and die of this 
disease. They also can spread it to those who are more vulnerable, and 
Inslee said we must anticipate a rise in hospitalizations as cases continue to 
climb.
 
If the people of Washi
ngton cannot get COVID under control through key 
steps such as avoiding gatherings and wearing cloth face coverings, the 


 
Wiesman also noted that the current trend of increasing cas
es would make 
it unsafe to resume in
-
person instruction in schools this fall.

You Weigh Risk of Gathering, Traveling
 
An

prepared by Georgia Tech and the Applied 
BioInfomatics Laboratory allows you to quickly calculate the risk of 
encountering at least one person
 
who is infected with COVID
-
19 in nearly 
every county across the U.S. A unique feature of the map is that it allows 
calculating risk based on the size of a potential gathering in each location, 
from as few as 10 people to as many as 10,000.
 
The map could b
e helpful in considering travel risk. Thinking about ignoring 
guidance that you limit trips, and are gearing up to attend a wedding in 
Phoenix, Ariz., with 50 guests? The data suggest a 98% chance of 
encountering somebody infected with COVID
-
19 at your des
tination.
 
In Snohomish County, attending a gathering with 10 people would present 
a 7% risk of encountering a COVID
-
19 infected person; a gathering of 100 
people 
--
 
53%; 1,000 people 

 
99%.

19 Twists to Tax Scams
 
The Internal Revenue Service today announced its annual 
"Dirty Dozen" list 
of tax scams
 
with a special emphasis on aggressive and evolving schemes 
related to coronavirus tax relief, including Economic Impact Paym
ents.
 
This year, the Dirty Dozen focuses on scams that target taxpayers. The 
criminals behind these bogus schemes view everyone as potentially easy 
prey. The IRS urges everyone to be on guard all the time and look out for 
others in their lives.
 
"Tax scams 
tend to rise during tax season or during times of crisis, and scam 
artists are using pandemic to try stealing money and information from 

the Dirty Dozen list to help raise awareness a
bout common scams that 
fraudsters use to target people. We urge people to watch out for these 
scams. The IRS is doing its part to protect Americans. We will relentlessly 
pursue criminals trying to steal your money or sensitive personal financial

Yesterday, 
Gov. Jay Inslee sent a
 
letter
 
to the Trump administration 
requesting the immediate implementation of a national aviation screening 
system for domestic and international passengers to ensure the safety of 
travelers 
and aviation workers.
 
The letter reads, in part:
 
"The science is clear that airplanes, and mass transit in general, present 
greater risk of transmission because of the confined spaces where safe 

 
improperly 
places the burden for protecting the public on state and local 
governments, leaves millions of passengers at risk, and fails to instill public 
confidence. It achieves neither our economic nor our public health goals.
 
"It is clear that if we hop
e to restart the U.S. economy in a manner that is 
safe and responsible, without significant interstate spread of COVID
-
19, we 
will need a comprehensive national aviation screening system. I 
respectfully request that you prioritize implementation of guidanc
e, 
regulations, and resources to implement this system."

give others enough space to launch safely. Leave at least one 
parking space between your vehicle and the veh
icle next to you.

Governor
 
Inslee
 
E
xpands 
Eviction Moratorium 
and 
Adds 
Additional Protections 
for 
Residential 
and 
Some 
Commercial Tenants
 
Yesterday, Gov
. Jay Inslee
 
expanded the previously issued eviction 
moratorium and added additional protections for residential and some 
commercial tenants.
 
The governor first proclaimed
 
a moratorium on evictions
 
in mid
-
March. 
The original moratorium applied only to dwellings that are captured in 
the Landlord Tenant Act, and prevented a landlord from e
victing or 
seeking an unlawful detainer order; prohibited landlords from serving 
any eviction order, or otherwise assisting in an evictions and provided 
exceptions for property damage, danger posed by a person to the 
safety/health of others or property.
 
No
tably, the original order did not cover all living situations or every 
circumstance, nor did it cover commercial rentals and leases.
 

 
new proclamation
 
extends and expands the original order 
through June 4th.
 
 
Just as in the original order, the new order prevents landlords from 
evicting in all situations that fall with
in the Landlord Tenant Act, and 

proclamation also:
 

 
Prohibits residential evictions in other dwelling situations, 
including but not limited to:
 
o
 
Lots/parcels (some motor home owners 
own the 
vehicle but lease the lot)
 
o
 
Transitional housing
 
o
 
Public lands 

 
camping grounds
 

 
Prohibits enforcement of agreements to vacate.
 

 
Prohibits a landlord from requiring a non
-
paying tenant to 
move to a lesser unit, and prevents landlords from threatening 
to take action against tenants.
 

 
Prohibits landlords from assessing or threatening to assess late 
fees or other charges for non
-
payment.
 

 
Prohibits landlord from assessing (or threatening to assess) rent 
for housing/parcel where the tenants access or use was
 
prevented as a result of COVID. Such as:
 
o
 
Seasonal/college housing closed;
 
o
 
People who planned to move in
 
but are prevented 
from doing so due to COVID
-
19;
 
o
 
People who were forced to leave due to COVID 
needs of their own or others.
 

 
Prohibits landlords from in
creasing rents or deposits for 
residential and commercial units.
 
o
 
As it relates to commercial rental properties, this 
prohibition applies only if the commercial tenant has 
been materially impacted by the COVID
-
19, whether 
personally impacted and is unable t
o work or whether 
the business itself was deemed non
-
essential or 
otherwise lost staff or customers due to the COVID
-
19 
outbreak.
 
o
 
This proclamation protects commercial tenants by 
prohibiting rent increases or threats of rent increases.
 

 
Prohibits landlords 
from treating unpaid rent and charges as an 
enforceable debt, unless the landlord demonstrates by a 
preponderance of the evidence to a court that the resident

PSA: #COVIDStopsWithMe
 
The U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services released a public service announcement (PSA) imploring 
Americans to do their part to stay healthy by following
 
a few simple 
instructions that will in turn, help prevent the spread of COVID
-
19:
 

 
Follow federal, state and local guidelines;
 

 
Take extra precautions if you are at
 
higher risk
 
for severe illness;
 

 
Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly; and
 

 
Stay six feet away from others when 
you can, and wear a face 
covering in public when you cannot social distance.
 
These steps are critical for everyone to take, because although everyone is 
not at equal risk for a severe case of COVID
-
19, everyone risks being 
infected with the virus that caus
es the disease and then spreading it to 
others.

Facility 
Opens This Week
 
Snohomish County is preparing a COVID
-
19 isolation and quarantine 
site to open this
 
week at the Angel of the Winds Arena in downtown 
Everett. This facility will provide a site for temporary isolation and 
quarantine for those who ma
y not be able to recover in their own 

who have COVID
-
19 would remain in isolation there until they are no 
longer contagious (e.g., 1
-
2 weeks), and those who were exposed but 
not ill would be
 
quarantined until having passed through the 14
-
day 
incubation period. The primary mission of the facility is to reduce 
transmission to the public.
 
 
 
The site will be a secure facility. Clients there will be directed to stay 
until released under orders iss
ued by the Snohomish Health District. A 
typical stay would extend from just a few days up to two weeks 
(occasionally longer), depending on the circumstances. The Snohomish 

a 
total of 
six commissioned law enforcement officers will monitor the 

-
to
-
seven security 
guards (depending on daily census) 24/7. The security firm is the same 
the arena normally uses, and they know the facility wel
l.

GOV. INSLEE PRESS CO
NFERENCE
 
During a press conference on 
Thursday, July 2, Governor Jay Inslee 
announced a pause on the phased 
reopening of counties

statewide rules regarding face 
coverings.

DAILY BRIEFING
 
Governor Announces Two
-
Week Pause on Phases, New Mask 
Rules for Businesses
 
During a press conference on Thursday, July 2, Governor 
Jay Inslee 
announced a pause on the phased reopening of counties as well as new 
statewide rules regarding face coverings.
 
The Governor is putting a two
-
week pause on any county in the state 
moving forward in the phases, starting immediately. No application
s will be 
considered until July 16. That means it will be a minimum of two more 
weeks before Snohomish County can seek approval to move from Phase 2 
to Phase 3. The County and Health District still will need to evaluate 
whether Snohomish County is meeting 
health and safety requirements 
before applying.
 
Also, starting Tuesday, July 7, businesses in Washington must refuse service 
to customers without a face covering
 
unless the customer 
informs the 
business they have
 
a medical exemption
. This expands to the rest of the 
state a rule that had been put in place in Yakima County. It 
is in addition to 
the existing statewide order that requires people to wear a face cover 
when they are in public.
 

about the recent increase in cases being reported. This is what caused us 
l
ast week to put a pause on plans for Phase 3. The numbers have 
continued to go in the wrong direction, with our case rates having

an increase in testing. The number of tests submitted weekly has been 
stable, but the numbers of positive results are increasing. Local health care 
providers are also reporting increased demand for testing from people with 
COVID 
symptoms.
 

County working together to again flatten the curve and get back on track. 
If we all follow the guidelines for Phase 2, limit non
-
essential trips, wear face 
coverings when out o
f the home, maintain that social distancing, and

19 Reports Show Concerning Patterns of Inequity, 
Rise in Cases Among Younger People
 
Today the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) and Bellevue
-
based Institute for Dise
ase Modeling (IDM) released two new reports 
analyzing COVID
-
19 data by age, race/ethnicity and primary language 

increasing impact on communities of color. The IDM report also points to 
rece
nt increases in COVID
-
19 among younger people.
 
DOH overview of race, ethnicity and language impacts throughout the 
pandemic
 

 
analyzes data for the entire pandemic to date, from the 
earliest cases of COVID
-
19 in Washington state through t
he end of June. It 
includes confirmed COVID
-
19 case, hospitalization and death rates by 
race and ethnicity for the state as a whole and by region. The report also 

primary language spoken, 
and will be updated regularly.
 
Report findings include:
 

 
Case rates over the pandemic for Hispanic people and Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander people are nine times higher 
than those of White people. Hospitalization rates are seven times 
higher for
 
Hispanics and ten times higher for Native Hawaiians or 
Other Pacific Islanders than those of White people. Case and 
hospitalization rates for Black people and American Indian or 
Alaska Native people are three times higher than those of White 
people.
 

 
Compa
red to White people, death rates are over three times 
higher among Hispanic people and Native Hawaiian or Other 
Pacific Islander people, twice as high among American Indian or 
Alaska Native people, and over 50 percent higher among Black 
and Asian people.
 

 
A
nalysis of these rates by region shows COVID
-
19 is found in 
significant numbers across racial and ethnic groups throughout the 
state and is not confined to certain areas, such as rural, urban or 
suburban regions.
 

 
While limited data on primary language must
 
be interpreted with 
caution, this analysis provides additional insight into community
-
specific impacts and related inequities. For example, high rates of 
hospitalizations among people whose primary language is not 
English or Spanish suggests these populat
ions may be experiencing 
more severe disease due to increased exposures and/or barriers to 
quality and affordable care.

IDM analysis of changing age and racial demographics
 

 
examines changes in the age and race of COVID
-
19 cases 
over time. Report findings include:
 

 
Cases have recently been shifting to younger age 
groups. People 
under age 35 represented 22 percent of cases from January to 
March, and by May/June represented 46 percent of cases.
 

 
Cases are increasingly concentrated in Hispanic people, who 
have accounted for 58 percent of COVID
-
19 cases with known 
race 
and ethnicity since the beginning of May despite making up 

at higher risk of infections for several reasons, including living in 
larger households, limited access to healthcare and working i
n 
essential services.
 

 
Recent data show Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 
people have the highest risk of disease on a per capita basis.
 

 
During May and June, Hispanic people were 13 times more likely 
and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander peo
ple were 17 
times more likely to get COVID
-
19 compared to White people.
 

 
The groups experiencing a higher COVID
-
19 burden in June are 
largely the same groups that have been disproportionately 
impacted in previous months, but the disparities among groups 
are
 
widening.

19 relief efforts in Washington 
has been postponed to June 24. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, 
organizers of

decided to postpone 
the event to a later date to not detract attention from the current anti
-
racism and police brutality protests taking place in Washington and across 
the country after the death of 
George Floyd.
 
All In WA is a coordinated statewide relief effort powered by a coalition of 
public officials, companies, philanthropic leaders, community foundations, 
United Way organizations, community leaders, frontline nonprofits, and 
individuals. These 
groups are coming together to provide immediate 
critical and emergency support for workers and families most affected 
across Washington State, and to mobilize committed community and 
philanthropic groups to go All In for WA. At launch, the effort had alrea
dy 
raised $20 million toward a $65 million goal to be met in coming months. 
Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos will match individual donations under 
$1
 
million to All In WA causes, up to a total of $25 million.
 
Donations can be made to the All In WA Fund, a
n aggregate fund that will 
address funding gaps across the state, or directly to Community funds and 
Cause
-
specific funds across Washington, including those in need of 
housing assistance, small businesses, families and children, essential workers 
and more.
 
Funds donated to the All In WA Fund will be distributed in the 
form of grants to nonprofit organizations across the state. A Fund Advisory 
Group has been established to oversee the grantmaking from the All In WA 
Fund.

19 and Help for Mental Health or

Steps are being taken locally and statewide to allow more activities and 
businesses 

 
as long as illness prevention measures are in place. However, 

distancing is expected to rem
ain part of our lives for the foreseeable 
future.
 
Social distancing is taking a toll on many. Separation from family and 
friends, job loss, and the stress and emotional strain of life during a 
pandemic can have serious consequences for mental health.

It is normal right now to feel scared, anxious, sad, angry, lonely, uncertain 

 
a whole range of emotions are appropriate during this unprecedented

a sign of weakness. People who have never called a crisis line may find

term response to 
the novel coronavirus disease (COVID

investigation and contact tracing are cruci
al, as well.
 
 
These topics have generated a number of questions, as 
well as concerns and rumors. SHD aims to address some 
of those here:
 
 
 
·         What is disease investigation and contact tracing?
 
·         When is the Snohomish Health District starting
 
contact tracing?
 
·         But COVID
-
19 is different.
 
·         So how many contact tracers do you need?
 
·         What happens if I test positive?
 

 

 
· 
        
How can I help with contact tracing?

New Claims for Unemployment Benefits in Snohomish County 
D
own 37% from the Week Before
 
During the week of May 24
-
30, there were 31,224 initial regu
lar 
unemployment claims, down 37
% from the prior week and 774,959 total 
claims for all un
employment benefit categories filed by Washingtonians, 
according to the Employment Security Department (ESD).
 
ESD believes the continued decrease is due to a variety of reasons, 
including fraud prevention measures and more people going back to work 
with 
the reopening of some industry sectors and regions over the past 
three weeks.

19 in Long Term Care Facili
t
ies
 
(LTCF)
 
Department of Health has reported that as of June 1, a total of 3,860 
COVID
-
19 cases (18% of total cases) and 690 deaths (61% of total deaths) 
have been identified as associated with a long term care facility, including 
nursing home, assisted l
iving facility or adult family home. These cases may 
include residents as well as employees and visitors, and currently, we have 
limited ability to distinguish amongst them.
 

 
These numbers have been identified using several sources of 
information including 
interviews with patients, medical record 
review and cross
-
matching address information.
 

 
We cannot say for certain that all of these cases were exposed at 
a LTCF. Many cases visited multiple places during their exposure 
period, and some individuals may have
 
visited a LTCF after disease 
onset.
 

 
Data are updated as we receive information that is more 
complete and may change over time as we learn more. We are 
working to improve this information going forward.

AG Calls for Legal Community t
o Assist Eligible Military and 
Veteran Families through the MEDAL Program
 

the Military Engagement and Directed Advocacy by 
Lawyers Program (MEDAL) connects volunteer 
attorneys to eligible military and 
veteran families facing 
select civil legal issues.
 
The program has received a dramatic increase in 
requests for legal assistance from veterans, service 
members stationed in
 
Washington, and their families 
since the COVID
-
19 pandemic struck. Many of the requ
ests are directly 
and indirectly related to the public health emergency, including requests 
for wills assistance from individuals in high
-
risk categories, request for 
assistance from small business owners and others impacted by the 
economic disruptions cau
sed by the pandemic.
 
Attorney General Bob Ferguson is asking the legal community to help with 
the increased requests for assistance. The AG is asking for volunteers that 
can handle one or more pro bono cases on behalf of military and veteran 
clients to ple
ase contact
 
OMVLA@atg.wa.gov

application

Important 
Reminder
: Stop the 
Spread 
by 
Staying Local
 
As counties are reopening and the weather warms up, it can be 
tempting 
to hit the road for a hike or day trip out of town. To prevent COVID
-
19 from 
spreading across county lines, it's important to stay close to home. 
Remember, staying home is still safest, but if you do go out: stay six feet 
from others, wear a face 
covering, wash your hands, and stay local.

Down 
2% from the Week Before

June 6, there were 29,713 initial regular 
unemployment claims, down 4.8% from the prior week and 729,053

House, is now on the way to the President for

to concerns that the PPP, potentially a grant if 
employers met established criteria, was so restrictive as to make 
compliance a difficult task.
 
The bill authorizes the following changes:
 
1.
 
Extends covered loan period from eight to 24 weeks.
 
2.
 
Ensures full acce
ss to employer payroll tax deferment for 
businesses that take PPP loans.
 
3.
 
Relaxes the requirement that PPP loans be spent on payroll costs 
from 75% to 60%.
 
4.
 

loan forgiveness if they are un
able to rehire employees due to 
effects of enhanced Unemployment Insurance.
 
5.
 

forgiveness if they cannot return to full business operations due to 
state orders or restrictions.
 
One issue which wa
s not resolved was use of PPP by all non
-
profit 
organizations. Many economic development organizations; like the 
Economic Alliance of Snohomish County (EASC), are private non
-
profits 
and currently cannot use the PPP.

Notice 2020

provides that cash payments employers make to charitable 
organizations that provide relief to victims of the COVID

19 pandemic in 
exchange for sick, vacation,
 
or personal leave which their employees 
forgo will not be treated as compensation. Similarly, the employees will not 
be treated as receiving the value of the leave as income and cannot 
claim a deduction for the leave that they donated to their employer.
 
E
mployers, however, may deduct these cash payments as a business 
expense or as a charitable contribution deduction if the employer 
otherwise meets the respective requirements of either section.

62.6% of households in 
Snohomish 
County have responded to the 2020 
Census, with almost 60% of those

All Passengers to be Temperature Checked Prior to Boarding
 
 
As part of its continuing commitment to be a national leader in protecting 
customers and staff, in effort to stop the spread of COVID

i
nfluenza and 
oth

fever detection system. Developed by Athena Security, the Elevated Body 
Temperature Detection System is a non

invasive, non

contact technology 
that alerts airport personnel when a passe
nger has a fever. The system was 


innovative and proprietary UV technology used to disinfect the terminal. 
The technology being deployed at Paine Field is the latest in a line of 
similar technology that has been used effectively for years in Asia and 
other parts of the world.
 
Prior to entering the TSA checkpoint, all passengers will be screened by a 
thermal cam
era that reads their body temperature. Passengers flagged as 
having a temperature will be offered secondary screening and if a fever is 
confirmed, the passenger and the airline will determine their ability to 
travel.
 


Temperature Detection System is a vital step to ensure the health and

COMMERCE DEPARTMENT UPDATE
 
The Department of Commerce 
provides an update on the ScaleUp 
program for small businesses, the 
business response center, and 
Economic Resiliency Team efforts.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A healthy workforce is necessary for a healthy economy. Washington state 
will take steps to get people back to work in a way that protects them and 
their communities.
 
The Department of Commerce will develop an 
operational plan that works 
for business, workers, and the public by convening industry representatives 
and business leaders, along with representatives of labor and workforce 
interests. The department will start where essential businesses have already 
put
 
protections in place and include the Department of Health and Labor 
& Industries early to provide advice and guidance. Working together, we 
can coordinate industry specific plans to meet health and safety approval 
and determine when the plan can be implem
ented.
 
"Public health is our number one priority and the economy immediately 
follows," said Commerce director Lisa Brown. "Data and science are our 
guiding lights through this pandemic. We want to get people back to work 
as quickly as possible, but we also
 
understand that our workplaces may 
look very different than they did prior to the outbreak, and that may be 
the case for some time to come. We're going to partner with our business 
community to understand what a safe return to work looks like for each 
ind
ustry."

The IRS has recently released a new Spanish language version of the tool

eir money quickly and easily.
 
The Non

Filers tool is designed for people with incomes typically below 
$24,400 for married couples or less than $12,200 for single people. This 
includes couples and individuals who are homeless. People can qualify, 
even if th
ey do not work. Anyone claimed as a dependent by another 
taxpayer is not eligible.
 
Usually, married couples qualify to receive a $2,400 payment while others 
normally qualify to get $1,200. People with dependents under 17 can get 
up to an additional $500 fo
r each child.
 
Just like people who file returns every year, those who do not have a filing 
requirement also generally qualify for an Economic Impact Payment. The 

file. So, the only way
 
to get the Economic Impact Payment is to register 
with the IRS.

 Statement on Phase II Actions
 Dave Somers, Snohomish County Executive
  ﬁI want to thank the Snohomish Health District Board of Health and the Snohomish County 
Council for agreeing to apply for a variance to move u
s into Phase II of the Governor™s Re
-opening Washington plan.
  I fully support their actions. Depending on announcements later 
today, we expect the plan to be submitted by the end of the day on Monday, June 1. The 

residents of Snohomish County have done th
e hard work in flattening our curve and taking care 
of one another by social distancing. As we apply for, and I hope enter, phase II, we will all need 
to remain vigilant about our activities. We need to get people back to work and not have a 
major spike in
 cases. It will be up to everyone to be smart and maintain the measures that have 
worked so far.ﬂ

DAILY BRIEFING
 
Gov. Inslee, Secretary Wiesman
 
Announce

In a press conference today, Gov. Jay Inslee
 
and Washington

that mandates 
the use of cloth face coverings in most public areas. The order takes effect

to wear a cloth 
face covering in public when you cannot stay six feet (or 
two meters) away from others. You must wear a face covering in indoor 
public settings except when you eat, and outdoors when you cannot stay 
six feet away from others at all times. 
You do not need t
o wear a cloth 
face covering in your home when you are only with people in your 
household, or when you are alone in your car. You do not need to wear 
one when you exercise outdoors with plenty of space.
 
Some people should not wear cloth face coverings:
 

 
Chi
ldren under two years of age
 

 
People who have disabilities that:
 
o
 
Prevent them from comfortably wearing or taking off face 
coverings
 
o
 
Prevent them from communicating while wearing face 
coverings
 

 
People who have respiratory conditions or breathing trouble
 

 
Peop
le who have been told by a medical, legal, or behavioral 
health professional not to wear face coverings
 
Violations of the facial covering directive will be a misdemeanor.
 
Further, Gov. Inslee announced he will require all Yakima businesses to 
require custo
mers to wear facial coverings to gain entry to the business.

Epidemiology Summary
 
COVID
-
19 activity continues to fall in Washington as me
asured by new 
hospital admissions for laboratory
-
confirmed COVID
-
19 and the proportion 
of individuals testing positive for COVID
-
19 each day. The total number of 
individuals tested increased almost 18% from the week ending April 18th to 
the week ending Apr
il 25th. We continue to have an average of about 215 
new COVID
-
19 cases reported every day.
 
PPE
 
The state continues its aggressive procurement of personal protective 
equipment (PPE) but still is not able to bring in enough supply to meet 
demand. Global sup
ply chain challenges have meant our incoming orders 
are not keeping pace with original vendor projections. The state is working 
to comprehensively review shipping challenges and identify opportunities 
to expedite orders. In addition, a ha
ndful of orders ha
ve been cance
led 
due to issues like quality, inability of a manufacturer to obtain needed 
supplies, and suppliers not receiving back
-
ordered items from 
manufacturers.
 
To date, approximately $9 million worth of PPE ordered has arrived and 
been 
accepted, out of the more than $343 million ordered. Because PPE 
supplies remain limited, state officials continue to prioritize
 
Tier 1 needs
 
which incl
ude hospitals, long
-
term care facilities and first responders. 
Information about purchasing and distribution of PPE is available on the
 

.
 
Food Su
pply
 
Last week the state distributed an estimated 1.4 million pounds of 
emergency food to serve 171,086 clients across the state. Food banks also 
received assistance from more than 600 Washington National Guardsmen 
who helped box more than 5.2 million poun
ds of food and assembled 
more than 230,000 meals.
 
This week, WSDA participated in a corporate donor outreach to update 
philanthropic organizations that are considering contributions to the 
Washington Food Fund. WSDA estimated a $5.5 million weekly burn
-
rat
e for 
meeting statewide food bank demand. WSDA continues to adjust ordering 
schedules and seek new sources and supply channels to fill an $11 million 
gap expected in the first weeks of May.
 
Unemployment Numbers
 
During the week of April 19
-
25, there 
were 1,455,908 total claims for 
unemployment benefits filed by Washingtonians for unemployment 
benefits, according to the Employment Security Department (ESD).
 
In addition, during the week of April 19
-
25, ESD paid out over $988 million 
(an increase of $811
.2 million from the previous week) to a total of 504,407 
claims (an increase of 151,498 from the previous week). An individual can 
file more than one claim, so the number of claims does not equate to 
individuals
.
 
Since the week ending March 7 when COVID
-
19
 
job losses began:
 

 
A total of 787,533 distinct individuals have filed for unemployment 
insurance
 

 
ESD has paid out nearly $1.5 billion in benefits to Washingtonians to 
more than 500,000 Washingtonians

Statement from Employment Security Department Commission
er Suzi 
LeVine on adjudication:
 

benefits to those people who are eligible for some form of unemployment 

right now to address this issu
e:
 
1.
 
Getting people who are eligible to be paid to take action. Tens of 
thousands of people have not filed their weekly claim, or do not 
know they are should apply for expanded unemployment benefits 
under the federal CARES Act. Targeted emails will remind th
em to 
take these important steps.
 
2.
 
Reaching out to those in adjudication for various reasons and 
updating them on the work we are doing to resolve their situation.
 
3.
 
Bulk
-
clearing certain issues when we can. For example, people 
who noted that they are a stude
nt as well as an employee, 
typically must show that they have enough hours in their week 
outside of school available to work. With most schools cancelled, 
this is an issue we have been able bulk
-
clear from many 
applicants, speeding up the process for many 
of those folks to be 
paid.
 
4.
 
Bringing on more customer service staff to both help people across 
the state process their claims and get through on the phones and 
free up our adjudicators to do the specialized work of resolving 

ripled our claims staff and we 
continue to hire, so please go to
 
esd.wa.gov/esdjobs
 
to see 
current postings.
 
We know people are struggling all across the state and many are in 
desperate situations. These are our friends, neighbors and 
families. I am so 

need it and we will continue to work hard to eliminate this backlog and 
get money to all those who are eligible as quickly as possible.

  EVERETT, Wash., May 1, 2020
 Œ Today, Snohomish County announced the re
-opening of county parks for 
day use on Tuesday, May 5, in coordination with Governor Inslee™s announcement this week that state 
parks will be open for many day use activities. Play structures, ball fields, and spray
 pads will remain 
closed. Parking lots and some gates will open. There are still no events or gatherings as per the 
Governor™s order, and camping and picnic shelter use is still not allowed until at least May 20, 2020. 
Playgrounds will remain closed until 
further notice. There may be portable restroom use at all parks. 
Limited parking will be enforced based on capacity. Flowing Lake Park will remain closed due to 
construction until further notice. This closure includes the entire park, boat launch, camping,
 playground, parking and restrooms.
  
Social distancing is still required at all times. Please come prepared with water, hand sanitizer, cloth 

facial coverings and follow all state and local health guidelines. Parks is also extending annual parking

to keep lowering the curve of the pandemic. 
  Welcome back to YOUR Snoco Parks! Keep up the good work

u have signs or symptoms of COVID
-19.
  Stick with your squad

immediate household who are not at high risk.
  Play prepared
 Œ Plan your park outing like you would for a hike. Pack food, water, s
upplies, hand 
sanitizer and a cloth facial covering.
  No space? Find another place
Œ If you get to your planned recreation destination and it is 
crowded or looks difficult to maintain social distancing, go to another nearby park or go home 

so you can stay sa
fe and avoid crowds. 
  Be considerate of other visitors
 Œ Maintain social distancing of 6 feet at all times.

19 Pulse Study
 

Network in April and June 2020, examined the state of mental health of 
Americans during the pan
demic.
 
The initial survey took an overall look at mental health in this country, with a 
deep dive into how veterans and military families are feeling.
 
New data in June brings insight into how Frontline Healthcare Providers and 
First Responders have dealt w
ith the pandemic. The study found that a 
majority of frontline health care workers and first responders expressed 
alarm over their mental health in response to their work during the COVID
-
19 pandemic.

Agreement, payments due between April 1 and July 15, 2020 are 
delayed. Those currently unable to meet the terms of an 
Installme
nt Payment Agreement
 
or Direct Deposit Installment 
Agreement may cancel payments during this period with no 
default. By law, interest will continue to accumulate on any 
unpaid balances.
 

 
New Installment Agreements 

 

federal ta
xes can establish a monthly payment agreement.
 

 
Pending Offer in Compromise applications 

 
Taxpayers have until 
July 15, 2020, to provide additional information for a pending

Delinquent return filings 

 
The IRS will not default an OIC for 
taxpayers who are delinquent in filing their tax return for 2018. 
However, they should file any delinquent 2018 return and their 
2019 return by July 15, 2020.
 

 
Non

More than 1 million households who haven't filed tax 
returns in the last three years are owed refunds. The deadline to 
get refunds on 2016 tax returns is July 15, 2020.
 
 
Those who owe 
taxes on delinquent returns may visit IRS.gov for 
payment 
options
. The longer the debt is owed, the more penalties and 
interest accrue.
 

 
Field collection activities 

 
IRS stopped field revenue officer 
enforcement actions, such as liens and levies. Revenue officers 
will continue to
 
pursue high
-
income non
-
filers and perform other 
similar activities where necessary.
 

 
Automated liens and levies 

 
IRS delayed issuing new automated 
and systemic liens and levies. Taxpayers experiencing a hardship 
due to a levy should reach out to their ass
igned IRS contact or 
fax their information to (855) 796
-
4524.

IRS has delayed new 
certifications of taxpayers who are considered seriously

widespread and significant, showing the continued need for a coordinated response to rebuild the local 
economy. Busi
nesses, non
-profits and other partners came together to advance efforts during the 
beginning of the crisis and continue to work hand
-in
-hand to be responsive and position the County to 
recover as quickly as possible.
     ﬁSnohomish County was ground zero f
or the first reported case of COVID
-19,ﬂ said Executive Somers. 
ﬁThrough those first few months, we led the country in response to the pandemic, and we are working 
towards being the first to fully recover. At the onset, our entire community stepped up, not
 only to 
respond but also to balance our recovery and resiliency efforts. The Task Force and the Advisory Groups 

in each district are part of a holistic effort. This is the beginning of a road map for our economic recovery 

and will help us build a resilien
t economy to provide opportunity and prosperity for all areas of the 
County
.ﬂ  
The major findings identified in the work of the Task Force and Advisory groups include:
  Ł For working 
families needing to return to work, K
-12 education and childcare is crucial and is 
linked to successful business reopening and economic recovery;
 Ł The importance of continuing to provide clear health & safety guidelines and timelines to 
support business reo
pening;
 Ł Businesses and workers will need ongoing support even as the economy re
-starts and will need 
continued support well into recovery;
 Ł The County™s most vulnerable populations have been disproportionately impacted by the 
pandemic and will need our supp
ort as the County recovers; and 
 Ł The need to be prepared for a future business climate with less certainty for planning and 

decision
-making.

     Nearly 
40 recommendations were identified in the report and the strategies fell into three categories:
   Response: 
Strategies to respond quickly to identify the needs of businesses and non
-profits who 
were mandated to close and remain closed until they are allowed
 to open. Strategies are 
designed to help stabilize a company and support its employees. 
  Recovery: 
Focus on businesses as they prepare to a reopen under the Safe Start program as well 

as those businesses that are already open. Even when open, these busine
sses will require 
continued support to ensure they can successfully operate.
  Resiliency: 
Prepares the economy should the virus strengthen, requiring more mitigation 
measures, and supports long
-term growth and shared prosperity throughout Snohomish 
County.
  Many of the strategies in the Response category are being implemented. To support further 
implementation, the Taskforce will identify which strategies can be supported with federal CARES Act 
resources. The Office of Economic Recovery and Resiliency will s
upport the coordination and 

implementation of these identified strategies. To determine which strategies should be implemented 
first, a Task Force committee will be tasked to rank the strategies based on the criteria outlined in the 
report. This will help 
the County determine which strategies can be implemented most quickly and 

effectively based on available resources.
  
ﬁI™d like to thank all those who have participated in district Advisory Groups to support our economic 

recovery efforts,ﬂ said Chair Nehrin
g. ﬁThe voices of small business owners and workers from across 
Snohomish County clearly express the difficulties they have faced during the pandemic. The strategic 
recommendations they have provided pave the way to support job creation and economic growth
.ﬂ  The Office of Economic Recovery and Resiliency supports the Economic and Workforce Recovery Task 
Force.

   Snohomish County Launches Rapid Response to Help Businesses and Workforce
  EVERETT, Wash., March 20, 2020
 Œ Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers today announced actions 
to support businesses and workers impacted by COVID
-19. This new program complements federal and 
state actions announced over the past week.
    ﬁIt is never too early to start our economic reco
very efforts,ﬂ said Executive Somers. ﬁWe know that people 
are hurting and are worried about paying for basic necessities. The sooner we can bring support to our 

businesses and workforce, the more quickly we™ll recover when this is over.ﬂ
  ﬁOur businesses 
are the backbone of our economy,ﬂ said Snohomish County Council Chair Nate Nehring. 
ﬁAnything we can do to keep employees working and businesses functioning will help the private sector 

quickly rebound from our current challenges.ﬂ
  
This response will help
 stabilize our local economy and provide much
-needed mechanisms for supporting 
businesses and our workforce. The goal is to support struggling businesses and their employees, 
particularly those who may find it hard to provide basic needs. Recognizing the e
volving circumstances of 
the pandemic, this flexible mechanism can be expanded and adapted as circumstances require.
  Because coordination is necessary around short and long
-term efforts, there is a critical need for 
innovative solutions to address our cur
rent challenges and those we can™t yet anticipate. Snohomish 
County is exploring every possible creative alternative to support the impacted business community and 

their employees during this challenging time.
   Snohomish
 County Economic & Workforce Recovery Task Force: 
A Blue Ribbon panel of public, 
private, and non
-profit sector officials will be tasked to develop direct actions to support the 
economic stabilization, recovery, and resiliency of businesses in Snohomish Co
unty and those 
workers who have been laid
-off as a result of the pandemic. This Task Force will work closely with 
Governor Inslee™s recently formed Task Force to support Washington state businesses. 
 
  Office of Economic Recovery & Resiliency: 
Executive Somers will create the Office of Economic 
Recovery & Resiliency. The primary focus of this office will be to stabilize our local economy, plan 
for economic recovery, build resiliency for our local employers, and support our local 
workforce.
  This
 will be a multi
-disciplinary effort focused on economic development, workforce 
training and support, and human services. The office will assist local businesses in recovery and 
workforce training and help organizations get our residents back to work while
 partnering 
with
  human service providers to support those most in need.

This case is one of only two reported in Washington state residents to date. 
Health care providers in the United K
ingdom were the first to recognize cases 
in late April, and providers in other states have identified cases as well. 
Following increased reports of previously healthy children presenting with a 
severe inflammatory syndrome with Kawasaki disease

like sympto
ms, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
issued
 
a
 
health
 
advisory
 
last Thursday with a case definition.
 
The current case definition includes the following
:
 

 
Under the age of 21, with a fever, laboratory evidence of 
inflammation, and severe illness involving more than two organs 
that requires hospitalization; AND

AND
 
DOM

VIOLENCE
 
The pandemic has amplified existing challenges in the community. Where 

struggling to climb out are facing more obstacles. Many in Snohomish 
County are dealing with illness, 
loss, disconnects from social circles and 
supports, and/or economic hardship.
 
Domestic violence is one of the issues that is exacerbated during this crisis. 
This can include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse of children and adults.
 
A full understanding 
of just how much of an impact this pandemic has had 

or, more likely, years.
 
But to get a better understanding of what is being seen now, what resources 
are available, and how people 
can help, the Health District reached out to 
some local experts. 
A
 
new
 
blog
 
on

was

today
. It includes insights and resources shared by Dawson Place

Assault and 
Abuse, and Domestic Violence Services of Snohomish County.

TESTING
 
Due to the shorter week, the Snohomish Health District will have one day of 
community
-
based testing
. Testing appointments will be on Thursday, May 28 
out
side the Sno
-
Isle Libraries branch located at 311 Maple Ave in Snohomish. 
Registration will open on Tuesday morning, with appointments beginning at 9 
a.m. and the last slot starting at 2 p.m.
 
These community
-
based testing sites are being operated by the Sn
ohomish 
Health District, with volunteer support from the Medical Reserve Corps. This 
test will not use the rapid test machines, but rather the regular nasal swabs 
that are sent to a lab. Results are expected to be communicated back to 
individuals within 2

3 days.
 
Criteria for testing and registration details remain the same. Updates and

Just as 
testing
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
piece
 
of the long

term response to the novel 
coronavirus disease (COVID

19), disease investigation and contact tracing 
are crucial, as well.
 
 
These to
pics have generated a number of questions, as well as concerns 
and rumors. The Health District published 
a
 
new
 
blog
 
on
 
contact
 
tracing
 
this
 
week
 
to help address some of those 
questions.

MIS

C is a new syndrome that has been identified in multiple countries in 
the 
past few weeks which seems to be associated with COVID

19 infection, even 
if COVID was asymptomatic or unrecognized. It manifests itself as a 
Kawasaki
-
like illness and/or as Toxic Shock
-
Like Syndrome. It needs to be 
recognized as early as possible, so 
that monitoring, treatment, and testing 
can be started early in its course for the best outcomes. That makes it 
essential for Pre
-
hospital & Hospital Providers to be aware of this new 
syndrome, as well as looking for signs and symptoms when evaluating thos
e 
younger than 21.

Businesses Ignoring Pandemic Closure Orders Can be Cited 
and Fined Under Emergency Rules Filed Today, May 26
 
 
Washington State Depar
tment of Labor & Industries (L&I) announced that 
Washington businesses that decide to open or operate in direct violation of 

unsafe workplace conditions under emergency rules filed toda
y by the state 
Department of Labor & Industries.
 
 
The closure order and the 
Safe Start Plan
 
to reopen businesses are in place 
to keep
 
workers and the public safe and to prevent the spread of the easily 
transmissible coronavirus.
 
 
The emergency rules, enacted at the direction of the Governor, take effect 
immediately. They give the Department of Labor & Industries (L&I) the 
authority to c
ite businesses for being open or for operating in a way that is 
purposely defying the phased
-
in approach and, as a result, putting their 
workers at risk.

IRS Announces Prepaid Debit Cards for Millions of Economic 
Impact Payments 
 
 
 
Nearly four million people are being sent their Economic Impact Payment by 
prepaid debit card, instead of paper che
ck. The determination of which 
taxpayers receive a debit card was made by the Bureau of the Fiscal 
Service, another part of the Treasury Department that works with the IRS to 
handle distribution of the payments.
 
 
 
These Economic Impact Payment Cards arrive
 
in a plain envelope from 
Money Network Cardholder Services.
 
 
The Visa name will appear on the front 
of the card; the back of the card has the name of the issuing bank, 
MetaBank®, N.A. Information included with the card will explain that the 
card is an Eco
nomic Impact Payment Card.
 
 
 
 
Those who receive Economic Impact Payment by prepaid debit card can 
do the following without any fees:
 
 
 

 
Make purchases online and at an
y retail location where Visa is 
accepted
 

 
Get cash from in
-
network ATMs
 

 
Transfer funds to their personal bank account
 

 
Check their card balance online, by mobile app, or by phone
 
 
 
This free, prepaid card also provides consumer protections available to

19 Misinformation
 
 
 
The World Health Organization has said that not only do we have a 
pandemic, but we also have an infodemic going on. An infodemic is too 
much information 

 
some accurate and some not 

 
that makes it hard for 
people to tell the difference between reliable information and harmful 

 
 
 
DOH counters common myths with the following facts:
 
 
 

 
FACT:
 
5G mobile networks DO NOT spread COVID

FACT:
 
The
 
government IS NOT going to force some people into 
quarantine facilities.
 

 
FACT:
 
COVID
-
19 DOES NOT spread easily from pets to people.
 

 
FACT:
 
Cloth face coverings WILL NOT decrease your oxygen.
 

 
FACT:
 
All the counties in the state WILL (probably) NOT be open J

FACT:
 
Camping at state parks IS NOT allowed (yet!)

New DOH Blog Post: 
 
Keep 
Your Hands Clean. 
And 

 
The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) published a 
new blog 
post reminding the community to keep hands clean and avoid touching 
your face. DOH advises that for most situations 

 
like driving, running 
errands, using an ATM, pumping gas, or pushing a shopping cart 

 
wearing 
gloves is not a helpful way to pro
tect yourself. It would be more helpful to 
use hand sanitizer frequently while running errands and be careful not to 
touch your face. Then, be sure to wash your hands with soap and water for 
20 seconds when you get home!
 
There are some times when you shoul
d wear gloves:
 

 
When you are cleaning and disinfecting your home. Look at the 
labels on your cleaning products. They may recommend that you 
wear gloves while using them. Be sure to open a window or turn on 
a fan to keep fresh air moving in the room you are 
cleaning.
 
 

 
If you are caring for someone who is sick with COVID
-
19 at home, 
use disposable gloves when cleaning the area around the person 
who is sick and when touching anything that had body fluids on it. 
Do not try to disinfect or reuse the gloves. Throw 
them away and 
wash your hands.

  Phase 2 Variance for Snohomish County to be Submitted Monday
 Board of Health and County Cou
ncil unanimously agree to proceed with variance proposal
  SNOHOMISH COUNTY, Wash., May 29, 2020 
Œ In a series of back
-to-back special meetings, the Board of 
Health and Snohomish County Council voted to approve resolutions in support of a Phase 2 variance 
application. The 
preliminary package is available online
.   ﬁI™d like to express deep gratitude to the staff and county leaders who have spent long hours preparing 

the materials needed for this thoughtful and comprehensive proposal,ﬂ said Stephanie Wright, Chair of 
the Board of Health and Vice Chair of the County C
ouncil. ﬁI am also most appreciative to the mayors, 
hospitals and other partners who jumped in quickly to provide their letters of support to include in this 
package.ﬂ 
  
Given updated criteria released today by Governor Inslee and the Washington State Depa
rtment of 
Health, slight modifications will be made over the weekend and a final package will be submitted on 
Monday. 
  ﬁCOVID
-19 has had varying impacts on different parts of our state, and we realize that county borders 
don™t prevent its spread,ﬂ said Ex
ecutive Dave Somers. ﬁI want to thank Governor Inslee for working in 
collaboration with us on how larger counties can safely begin to reopen. I look forward to submitting our 

request and continuing to focus our efforts on the health and wellbeing of our re
sidents and 
businesses.ﬂ
  
One significant change in Snohomish County™s favor is increasing the incidence of case counts from 10 to 
25 new cases per 100,000 in a 14
-day period. The Snohomish Health District calculates its rates based on 
CDC weeks, which are
 Sunday through Saturday. It is anticipated that a recent downward trend in new 
cases this week will reflect an incidence rate well within the new threshold for Phase 2.
  ﬁUpon our initial review, the revised benchmarks would seem to further indicate that 
Snohomish County 
is ready to move forward to the next phase,ﬂ said Dr. Chris Spitters, health officer for the Snohomish 

Health District. ﬁWe look forward to reviewing Secretary Wiesman™s revised guidance further and for 
 Snohomish County
 Emergency Management
     requesting a variance as soon as it 
becomes available to us and then updating and submitting our 
updated application on Monday.ﬂ
  
The community is reminded that until approved by the Secretary of Health, Snohomish County remains 
in Phase 1. Residents and businesses should continue following principals laid out in the Stay Home, Stay 
Healthy orders while beginning to familiarize thems
elves with what moving to Phase 2 will look like. 
  ﬁI am proud of this bipartisan effort to move Snohomish County to Phase II and safely reopen our 
businesses,ﬂ said Nate Nehring, Chair of the County Council. ﬁIt is a blessing to be a part of a team of 
lo
cal leaders who recognize the difficult sacrifices which have been made by our local businesses and 
workers and the need to safely get them back to work as soon as possible.ﬂ  
  In Phase 2, general guidelines include: 
 Ł Gatherings with no more than 5 people
 from outside your household per week. This includes 
outdoor recreation like camping, hiking or beach trips. 
 Ł High
-risk populations 
Œ such as people older than 60, those with underlying health conditions, or 
pregnant women 
Œ should continue to stay home as
ide from essential business and errands. 
 Ł Non
-essential travel will be limited to activities that are approved to reopen under Phase 2, and 
those will come with health and safety guidance to follow. For example, restaurants could 

reopen at limited on
-site 
capacity, with appropriate social distancing, no more than five 
customers per table, and no bar
-area seating. 
 Ł For people who can continue to work remotely, teleworking is strongly encouraged. 
  Allowing more businesses and activities to reopen does not me
an that it will be businesses as usual. 
There are guidelines that employers will need to follow through all of the phases. A brief overview is 
below, but more is 
out
lined in the Safe Start Plan
.  Ł Limit close interactions with customers. Arrange for six
-foot physical distance between 
employees and patrons and use other measures, such as barriers to block sneezes and coughs, if 
distancing isn™t realistic for specific ta
sks.  
 Ł Ensure sanitation and hand hygiene are available to all workers and visitors. 
 Ł Frequently clean and disinfect the workspace, especially high
-touch surfaces.  
 Ł Follow Labor and Industries (L&I) and industry
-specific guidance regarding personal protec
tive 
equipment or cloth face covers for workers. 
 Ł Encourage clients and customers to wear cloth face covers. 
 Ł Make a plan for addressing illness, including requiring ill employees to stay home and deep 
cleaning if an employee tests positive for COVID
-19.  
 Ł Provide information to employees about COVID
-19 and illness prevention. This could include 
signs or posters with information. 
 Ł Follow any additional guidance that is specific to your industry, as provided by local, state or 

federal public health professio
nals. 
  Businesses must wait until they have industry
-specific health and safety guidance before reopening 
within the proper phase. Guidance for all businesses may not be available at the same time. For 
example, Phase 2 guidance for construction was issued
 on May 15 while guidance for real estate was 
issued on May 19. The governor™s office 
maintains a list of guidance for industrie
s.

What You Should Do:
 
-
 
Be educated! There is no known cure for COVID
-
19 at this
 
time 
and there is no vaccine available.
 
-
 
Be skeptical. If a claim for an untested or little
-
known product 
sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
 
-
 
Carefully check the email addresses for messages supposedly 
coming from the Centers for Disease Control an
d Prevention or 
the World Health Organization. Best practice is to visit their 
actual websites by typing
 
cdc.gov
 
or 
who.int
 
into your web 
browser to get reliabl
e, up
-
to
-
date information.
 
-
 
Do NOT open attachments or click on links in unsolicited emails 
or texts about medical products or global health crises.
 
-
 
Make sure you are up to date with your security software, 
browser and operating system, and run antivirus so
ftware 
regularly.

 Snohomish County Economic Recovery Task Force Working to Jumpstart 
Economy 
 Executive Somers and Council Chair Nehring formally launch economic recovery efforts
  SNOHOMISH COUNTY, Wash., April 21, 2020
 Œ Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers and County 
Council Chair Nate Nehring held the first Snohomish County Economic and Workforce Recovery Task 
Force, laying the groundwork for economic recovery. The Task Force™s inaugural meeting set in motion a 

collaborative approach to rebuilding both the county™s econ
omy and its workforce by businesses, 

governments and non
-profits. The 29
-member Task Force is co
-chaired by Ray Stephanson, former 
Mayor of Everett, and Amy Drewel of Mosaic Insurance, LLC, and is charged with providing short and 

long
-term plans for the co
unty to assist the private sector and impacted employees as they recover from 
the COVID
-19 pandemic.
  Executive Somers emphasized the important work the Task Force will be embarking on to plan for and 
support economic recovery in the county. 
  ﬁThe suddenn
ess of our economic downturn is something none of us has ever experienced.
  We know 
that there are significant challenges to restarting our economy,ﬂ said Somers.
  ﬁBy working together we 
can develop a data
-driven strategy to respond to the needs of our em
ployers and employees. We also 
must take advantage of any new opportunities.
  This truly is a countywide approach, a whole
-of-government and a whole
-of-county effort.
  Our resiliency and partnerships will set us on the path 
toward recovery.ﬂ
    The ﬁBlue R
ibbonﬂ Task Force was formed to be action
-oriented with representation by those impacted 
by COVID
-19, including large and small businesses and industry associations from across the county. In 
addition, an Advisory Group is being established to complement t
he Task Force. The Advisory Group is a 
key mechanism to ensure the Task Force hears what is happening on the ground, gains the most 

accurate information in real time, and learns about the most innovative ideas from all corners of the 

county and beyond.
  An Advisory Group will be formed in each County Council district by the relevant 
Councilmember, and each Advisory Group will be responsible for helping the Task Force understand 

what our local communities need.
 The Advisory Group plans to have representation
 from our cities, 
Tribes, educational institutions, labor organizations, and non
-profits partners. Council Chair Nate 
Nehring will serve as the Advisory Group Chair and coordinate the work between the Advisory Groups 
and the Task Force.

 Dave Somers
 County Executive
     ﬁThe wave of eco
nomic disruption from COVID
-19 has hit every corner of our county and region,ﬂ said 
Chair Nehring. ﬁIn order to determine how we can best support the private sector and get everyone 
back to work, we need broad
-based input from every street corner, neighbor
hood, and office park. We 
want to ensure that government doesn™t hinder business recovery but instead is doing everything in its 
power to help.ﬂ
  The Office of Economic Recovery and Resiliency will support the Economic and Workforce Recovery Task 
Force.

County Mayors

As your mayors of Snohomish County, we want to acknowledge what a 
tremendous burden this has been on all of our residents, and the great 

 
collective adherence to public health guidelines, are achieving the 
intended result. Our efforts are working. Though new cases of COVID

continue to emerge each day, there are hopeful signs that the rate of 
transmission is slowing down. Our county is, i
n fact, leading the state in 

health threat seriously and doing their part to keep us all safe. Thank you.
 
Each day that passes, though, is another day that some of us are without 
w
ork, our kids are out of school, our businesses are pushed to the brink of 
survival, or in many cases forced to close. All of us are wondering how 
much longer? When will it be safe again? There is a strong desire, that we 
as mayors agree with, to better un

Governor Jay Inslee responded to President's Trump's threat to deploy the 
military in response to protesters.
 
"This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing. He has 
shown nothing but false bravado throughout 
the chaos that has 
accompanied his time in office.
 
His admiration of authoritarians around the 
world should not allow him to violate 200 years of American tradition of 
local law enforcement. We have activated the National Guard in our state 
and made them a
vailable to any community who requests it.
 
"Our country is defined by our collective character and democratic ideals, 
not by reactionary calls for division and not by threatening Americans with 
their own military."

How to 
File a Discrimination Complaint
 
Any individual who believes that he or she has been discriminated against 
based on protected class status may file a charge of discrimination with 
the Washington State Human Rights Commission (WSHRC).
 
Under the law, everyone
 
has the right to be free from discrimination at 
work, in housing, in a public accommodation, or when seeking credit and 
insurance. A discrimination charge in employment, public 
accommodation, credit and insurance must be filed with WSHRC within six 
months
 
from the date of the alleged violation in order to protect your 
rights. A discrimination charge in housing must be filed with the WSHRC 
within one year from the date of the alleged violation.

City of Edmonds Makes Hand Sanitizer
 
When faced with a hand sanitizer shortage, Edmonds City staff took 
matters into their own hands an

cost.
 
It all started when Thom Sullivan and Craig Cottrell, working out of the 

available hand sanitizer options for City facilities and found only o
ver
-
priced products, if any at all. Rather than give up, the team got creative. 
They googled how to make hand sanitizer, found the formula on the World 

with our Wastewater Treatment 
Plant laboratory.
 
The laboratory, managed by Jeanne McKenzie, is always busy providing 
operational testing at the plant and, even more importantly, testing the 

regulatory requirements. Th
e laboratory is very well equipped and 
undergoes frequent reviews to maintain its certification. They have all the 
necessary facilities and expertise to produce high quality hand sanitizer.
 
Craig, Thom and Jeanne contacted suppliers and bought bulk isoprop
yl 
alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and food grade glycerin to make the first 
batch. It produced approximately 75 eight
-
ounce bottles. They purchased 
1,000 empty bottles to put product in and printed the necessary labels. The 
first batch was distributed to our F
irst Responders and selected other City 
workers. They plan to keep making it until the public health crisis is over and 
hope to distribute the product to all City staff 
soon.

announcement:
 

Due to circumstances

This was a very difficult 
decision to make.

I know 
this breaks
 
a
 
tradition
 
that ha
s
 
stood for many years.
 
This was not my 
choice alone. I consulted with officers of the Post, Auxiliary and the S.A.L.
 
If 
you know me well, you know I take Memorial Day very seriously. I normally 
take a week 
of vacation during this time to make the preparation for this 
sacred holiday. This saddens my heart as I know too well this will break 
many of yours too.
 
Please Stay Safe. Stay Home. Stay Healthy. We are in this 
together.

County Approved to Move to Phase 2
 Secretary of Health
 has provided his approval to
 proceed based on variance proposal
  SNOHOMISH COUNTY
, Wash., 
June 
5, 2020 
Œ Snohomish County and the Snohomish Health District received 
notifi
cation 
from Secretary of Health John Wiesman today that their
 Phase 2 variance
 application
 has been 
approved. 
The official approval letter is available online
, and is effective immediately.
  ﬁSnohomish County can now start reopening our businesses and get more people bac
k to wo
rk,ﬂ said
 County
 Executive
 Dave
 Somers. ﬁDuring a pandemic, every step forward must be done carefully, and I am thankful for 
the work each of us throughout our community has done to get us here today.  As we transition into the next 
phase we must re
main vi
gilant to maintain social distancing and necessary sanitation practices to keep our 
communities healthy and help our economy recover as quickly as possible. I would like to thank Governor Inslee 
and Secretary Wiesman for their support in moving Snoh
omish C
ounty to Phase 2. It™s vital that each of our 
businesses and every county resident carefully review and adhere to the guidance for Phase 2. We still have a 
ways to go, but this is a first, positive step in the right direction.ﬂ
  
Now that the plan ha
s been 
approved, Snohomish County businesses authorized to open in Phase 2 may do so 
as long as they are able to meet their 
industry
-specific health and safety guidelines
. General questions about 
how to comply with the agreement practices can be submitted to the state™s Business Response Center at
 https://coronavirus.wa.gov/how

.   ﬁThanks to the hard work and sacrifices of many, we are well
-positioned for the next
 phase here in Snohomis
h Count
y,ﬂ said Stephanie Wright, Chair of the Board of Health and Vice Chair of the County Council. 
ﬁWe need to 
proceed carefully as a community to ensure cases remain low so that we can continue on this phased re
-opening 
path.ﬂ
  The Washington State Depa
rtment 
of Health recently 
launched a risk assessment dashboard
. Individuals can see 
data at the county
- and state
-level relating to the metrics used to determ
ine rea
diness to move between phases. 
The Snohomish Health District will also be reporting out on its progress on a weekly basis moving forward. 
  ﬁWe appreciate the time and thoughtful consideration that Secretary Wiesman 
and his team 
put int
o reviewing 
our prop
osal, and are
 glad to hear that 
they agree
 that
 we have the plans and processes in place to move 
forward,ﬂ said Dr. Chris Spitters, Health Officer for the Snohomish Health District. ﬁWe will be closely monitoring 
the data and metrics to ensure we ar
e able 
to accommodate the potential increase in cases, and adapt as 
needed, as we begin to open Snohomish County back up.ﬂ
 Snohomish County
      While Phase 2 does re
-open some businesses and activities, there are still restrictions in place that residents 
should be aware of. 
In Phas
e 2, general guidelines include: 
 Ł Gatherings with no more than 5 people from outside your household per week. This includes outdoor 

recreation like camping, hiking or beach trips. 
 Ł High
-risk populations 
Œ such as people older than 60, those with und
erlying
 health conditions, or 
pregnant women 
Œ should continue to stay home aside from essential business and errands. 
 Ł Non
-essential travel will be limited to activities that are approved to reopen under Phase 2, and those 
will come with health and safety
 guidan
ce to follow. For example, restaurants could reopen at limited 
on-site capacity, with appropriate social distancing, no more than five customers per table, and no bar
-area seating. 
 Ł For people who can continue to work remotely, teleworking is strong
ly enco
uraged. 
  ﬁOur businesses and residents are ready to safely get back to work, and the transition to Phase II will help do 
just that,ﬂ said Snohomish County Council Chair Nate Nehring.  ﬁOur local economy needs this boost, and I™m 
grateful for the bi
partisa
n effort at the local level to advocate for safe reopening.ﬂ
  Beginning June 8, all employees will be required to wear a cloth facial covering, except when working alone in an 

office, vehicle, or at a job site, or when the job has no in
-person inter
action.
 Employers must provide cloth facial 
coverings to employees, unless their exposure dictates a higher level of protection 
based on 
safety and health 

rules and guidance
 from the
 Department of Labor and Industries
 (L&I)
. Refer to
 L&I™s 
Coronavirus Facial 
Covering and Mask Requirements
 for additional details. Employees may choose to wear their own facial 
coverings at work, provided it meets the minimum req
uiremen
ts.
  Employers must also post signage at their place of business strongly encouraging customers to wear cloth facial 
coverings. Businesses are encouraged to require customers to wear cloth facial coverings, in order to protect 
employees from exposur
e to CO
VID
-19 in the workplace.
  The City of Everett, in partnership with the Snohomish Health District, has developed a toolkit to help small 
businesses begin to navigate Phase 2.
 This resource can help guide business owners as they create a safe 
reopenin
g plan 
and welcome back customers in the coming days and weeks.

    COVID
-19 Emergency Sheltering
 Immediate assistance for those most vulnerable to 
COVID
-19 in Snohomish County
  EVERETT, Wash., March 25, 2020
 Œ Snohomish County and its partners are working hard to protect 
everyone in the community against the spread of COVID
-19, including people who are experiencing 
homelessness, particularly parents 
with children, veterans, and other vulnerable individuals. 
  The Salvation Army is temporarily providing shelter for up to 40 people per night at the Carnegie 

Resource Center. Approximately $137,000 in funding has been approved to support this effort. To c
reate 
further social distancing in the shelter, the County has also provided an additional $250,000 in funding 

to The Salvation Army to move individuals into 44 units in an Everett motel.
 On March 17, 2020, the County, 
Providence Institute for a Healthier 
Community (PIHC), and the 
Community Foundation of Snohomish County (CFSC) announced a joint effort to immediately start 

providing additional motel/hotel vouchers to individuals and families who are on the countywide 
coordinated entry list, are experiencing
 homelessness, and are at high vulnerability for COVID
-19.
 An initial $20,000 seed grant from the Providence Institute for a Healthier Community was leveraged by 
$80,000 from the County for Phase One of the Homeless Community Containment/Protection Initiat
ive 
to establish housing for an initial 1,000 bed nights, expected to house approximately 33 families per 
night for 30 nights. Since the launch of that initiative last week, an additional $250,000 has been secured 
to provide motel/hotel vouchers. 
  ﬁThis e
xpanded sheltering capacity is helping Snohomish County and our partners provide more safe 
places for vulnerable community members during this challenging time while also reducing risk for 
residents throughout our county,ﬂ 
said Mary Jane Brell Vujovic, Dir
ector of Snohomish County Human 
Services. 
  
People experiencing homelessness are encouraged to dial 2
-1-1 for help.

The CDC has increased by
 
three days the period of recommended 
isolation after COVID

19 symptoms appear. Previously it recommended 
seven days isolation. The new guidance is 10 days.
 
This more cautious approach is intended to more stringently limit 
transmissions that may occur invo
lving persons following recovery from 
illness and thereby enhance ongoing efforts to control COVID
-
19 illness. 

incidence decreases it will affect fewer persons and thereby limit ov
erall 
societal burden of time spent in isolation.
 
Recommendation
 
For persons recovered from COVID
-
19 illness, CDC recommends that 
isolation be maintained for at least 10 days after illness onset and at least 3 
days (72 hours) after recovery. Illness onset 
is defined as the date 
symptoms begin. Recovery is defined as resolution of fever without the use 
of fever
-
reducing medications with progressive improvement or resolution 
of other symptoms. Ideally, isolation should be maintained for this full 
period to th
e extent that it is practicable under rapidly changing 
circumstances.

Statement from Local Government Leaders on Phased Re
-
Opening
 
Yesterday, local government leaders issued a follow
-
up statement on the 
COVID
-
19 reopening plan issued last Friday by Gov. Jay Inslee.
 
For the last few months, the world has been faced 
with a widespread, 
deadly pandemic that required quick and decisive leadership. Since the 
first COVID
-
19 case was reported in Snohomish County in January, the 
Governor and regional partners have shown just such leadership. We led 
the nation going into the 
crisis, and now other states look to Washington as 
an example. We used to have more COVID
-
19 cases than anywhere else 

Stay Home, Stay Healthy order is self

evident: our health care
 
systems 
continue to function well; infection rates appear to have peaked; and we 
are effectively flattening the curve. Most importantly, we are saving lives. 
The support and participation of our residents has played a huge role in this 
success, and we tha

and work for the good of our community.
 
We have lost over 100 souls to this virus, and we will lose more. The question 
is how many? Each was a person with a name, a life, a family and friends, 
and one 
of our neighbors. Everything we have been asked to do is to save 
lives, to ensure that the sick get the care they need, to buy time for 
treatments, and to hopefully develop a vaccine.
 
Our work is not done, however, and it is imperative that we hold steady 

Friday extends the timeline for us all to Stay Home, Stay Healthy, outlines 
the conditions that must be achieved for additional restrictions to be lifted, 
and sets forth a reasonable, phase
d approach for us to re
-
open our 
communities. We support this science
-
based, data
-
driven plan and remain 
committed to supporting the implementation of this next stage of 
response. We appreciate the Governor providing a helpful roadmap and 
relevant details 
on the phases of reopening, since it helps us and our 
business owners have the information we need to make plans for re

Cheeseburger Babies Foundation President Seaun Richards, the event 
sponsor, informed the city that he has made the difficult decision to cancel 

 
officials before making 
this decision. Due to the adverse impacts of the COVID

19 public health 
emergency, inability to attract sponsorships, and the status of social 
distancing still uncertain for July, Mr. Richards said it makes sense to cancel 
it this 
year and start planning for next year.

DAILY BRIEFING
 
Stay Home, Stay 
Healthy Updates from S
nohomish Health 
District
 
Residents are encouraged to go outside and enjoy the sunshine. Do so 
safely by staying close to home, maintaining at least six feet of distance 
from others who are not household members, and respecting closure
s or 
partial closures of parks, playgrounds or other outdoor venues.
 
Recommendation on Face Coverings
 
The Snohomish Health District recommends residents wear a cloth face 
covering when it is challenging to keep a six
-
foot distance from others 
outside the h
ome.

Summer Events and Programs
 
As 
mentioned last month
, there are many summer events that people 
have been planning for several months, as well as annual summer 
programs that would usually be gearing up or enrolling participants right 
n
ow.
 
Due to the ongoing pandemic, people should not be planning for summer 
events the same way they normally would. This illness and the measures 
needed to limit its spread will require adjustments to plans, even ones that 
are scheduled for weeks or months 
in the future.

thru Testing
 
The Health District and Medical Reserve Corps volunteers had been 
piloting two rapid test machines recently. Du
ring the four days of 
operations, 145 people were tested between the two locations.
 
However, the rapid test machines are not meant for high volume testing. 
They are also not well suited for frequent repositioning between locations. 
Instead of utilizing the
 
machines for community
-
based test sites, the Health 
District will move forward with drive

s that use
 
operations similar to 
the site open in March.
 
The Health District had previously reported that a drive

thru testing site 
would be available in th
e north end next week. Those plans have been 
delayed by a week to allow staff to complete needed planning to change 
the operation set

Case Counts and Updates
 
Updated case counts are done daily Monday through Friday, with any 
changes over the 
weekend included in the Monday updates. The Health 
District will be making a few adjustments to how data is shown for long
-
term care facilities and testing.
 
Daily updates had been including a breakdown of cases and deaths at 
individual long
-
term care facil
ities that had more than 10 cases at its site. 
Starting today, daily updates will only include the roll
-


weekly report for more detailed analysis specific to long
-
term care 
facilities.
 
The other adjustment is the bar graph providing the number of COVID
-
19 
tests completed per day in Snohomish County. Many have asked us to 
show the numbers for each corresponding day/bar. Adding that would

IRS: Act by Wednesday for Chance to Get Quicker Economic 
Impact Payment
 
With a variety of steps underway to speed Econo

the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service urged people 
to use 
Get My Payment
 
by noon Wednesday, May 13, for a chance to get 
a quicker del
ivery.
 
The IRS, working in partnership with Treasury Department and the Bureau of 
Fiscal Services (BFS), continues to accelerate work to get Economic Impact 
Payments to even more people as soon as possible. Approximately 130 
million individuals have alread
y received payments worth more than $200 
billion in the program's first four weeks.
 
Starting later this month, the number of paper checks being delivered to 
taxpayers will sharply increase. For many taxpayers, the last chance to 
obtain a direct deposit of 
their Economic Impact Payment rather than 
receive a paper check is coming soon. People should visit 
Get My 
Payment
 
on 
IRS.gov
 
by noon Wednesday, May 13, to c
heck on their 
payment status and, when available, provide their direct deposit 
information.
 
After noon Wednesday, the IRS will begin preparing millions of files to send 
to BFS for paper checks that will begin arriving through late May and into 
June. Taxpay
ers who use 
Get My Payment
 
before that cut
-
off can still take 
advantage of entering direct deposit information.

SNOHOMISH COUNTY 
 
DAILY BRIEFING
 
Gov. Jay Inslee 
Suspends Certain Statutory Requirements 
for Open Public Meetings and Public Records
 
On Tuesday Gov. Inslee 
signed a proclamation suspending certain 
statutory requirements in the Open Public Meetings Act (OPMA) and 
Public Records Act (PRA) for 30 days.
 
The OPMA requires public meetings have facilities made available for 
people to attend. Waving this requirement 
now 
works to prevent the 
gathering of people to further curb the spread of the virus. However, 

defined in RCW 42.30.020, or matters necessary to address the COVID
-
19 outbreak, for the 30 
days the proclamation is active.
 
The PRA mandates public access to agency facilities 
for
 
review and 
copy
ing of
 
public records. Many 
local government
 
offices
 
are closed 

-
essential businesses close or
 
begin teleworking
. Those 
conditions make
 
it difficult 
for agencies 
to respond to requests 
with
in the five
-
day 
deadline. Under this order, the requirement for agencies to respond to 
or acknowledge all records requested in the PRA mandated timeframe 
is 
waived. However, agencies are still expected to continue to respond 
promptly and to the greatest and fullest extent possible.

More on Testing
 
Testing is one of the key pieces of the COVID
-
19 response, and it is 
something that has changed and expanded over time. Testing will 
continue to play a crucial role in reducing the spread of illness, responding
 
to outbreaks, tracking this pandemic, and 

 
ultimately 

 
being able to 

 
COVID
-
19 testing is much more widely available now than it was in the 
early days of the pandemic. Snohomish County currently h
as more testing 
capacity than demand. In some ways, that can be good news, as it may 
signal that fewer people are in need of testing. But ideally, more people 
should be getting test to better track the status of COVID
-
19 in the 
community. It shapes the Hea

and informs efforts to curb the spread of this disease by isolating cases, 

answer some of those questions, the Health District has publis

INSLEE TAKES ACTION 
ON THREE 
PROCLAMATIONS
 
Gov. Jay Inslee signed two new and 
one updated proclamation
 
in 
response to the continuing COVID
-
19 
pandemic.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of Health
 
(DOH) and the Department of 
Labor & Industries (L&I)
 
Safety & 
Health Assessment & Rese
arch for Prevention (SHARP) program.
 
The report details total COVID
-
19 cases, by occupation and industry, 
through May 27. The information about occupation, industry and employer 
was collected during interviews with people who tested positive for 
COVID
-
19.
 
The highest number of infections is among workers in health care and 
social assistance. The manufacturing industry has the second highest 
number of cases. This includes traditional manufacturing businesses as well 
as food processing facilities.
 

ant to note that while the risk for contracting COVID
-
19 may be 
higher for people depending on their industry or occupation, this report 
reflects where people work, not where or how they were infected.
 
It can 
be difficult to determine with certainty where 
and how people get 
infected. In addition, healthcare workers have been a priority testing 
group since the start of the pandemic potentially resulting in increased 
detection of COVID
-
19 in this group.
 
Many of the people who provided occupation and industry 
information 
when interviewed by public health after testing positive for COVID
-
19 also 
provided information about race and ethnicity. Looking at data on race 
and ethnicity by industry and occupation can help identify workers at 
higher risk of contracting t
his illness and help focus our prevention efforts. 
For example, 12 percent of Hispanic and Latinx workers are employed in 
agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, while 21 percent of COVID
-
19 
cases among these workers are in that industry.
 
Additional st
udies are needed to better understand the risks of certain 
occupations for COVID
-
19. This report will be updated regularly online.
 
Inslee Takes Action on Three Proclamations
 
Gov. Jay Inslee signed two new and one updated proclamation Friday in 
response to 
the continuing COVID
-
19 pandemic.
 
The proclamations are as follows:
 
Shared Work 

 
20
-
58
 
 
This proclamation waives/suspends the statute that requires shared work 
benefits to be paid by employers, thereby allowing federal CARES Act 
funding to be used to pay for the employer portion of shared work 
benefits. The proclamation will expire on July 19
.
 
Temporary Licensing 

 
Dental and Pharmacy Graduates 

 
20
-
59
 
Due
 
to the impact of COVID on the inability of recent dental, dental 
hygiene, and pharmacy graduates to meet statutory licensing 
requirements, this proclamation allows dental hygiene and pharmacy 
graduates to obtain a temporary license if certain conditions a
re met. The 
proclamation will expire on July 19.

The state Department of Health has a new blog post with advice for 
summer fun.
 

o go outside! The good news is, when it comes to 
COVID
-
19, just about anything you can come up with to do outside is 
going to be lower risk than a gathering indoors.
 

people looki
ng forward to being outside, and if you end up along a trail or 

people 

 


 
put 
that cloth face covering on.
 
As you are cons
idering your plans for the summer, the keys to COVID
-
free 
summer fun are:
 

 
Outside is lower risk than inside.
 

 
Small gatherings are lower risk than large gatherings.
 

 
Stay at least six feet away from other people as much as possible.
 

 
Wash your hands, and keep
 
a bottle of hand sanitizer within easy 
reach. Like next to the sunscreen and bug spray.

ACROSS 
WASHINGTON
 
The latest statewide situation report 
from the Washington State 
Department of Health shows 
COVID
-
19 transmission is still accelerating 
across most of the state as of the end 
of June.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SNOHOMISH COUNTY 
 
DAILY BRIEFING
 
COVID
-

 
The Washington State Department of Health on Friday released the latest
 
statewide situation report
, which shows COVID
-
19 transmission is still 
accelerating across most of the state as of the end of June.
 
The report highlights concerning COVID
-
19 trends in Snohomish County 
and elsewhere around Puget Sound, in Spokane County, no
rth
-
central 
counties and southwest counties. The reproductive number

the 
estimated number of new people each COVID
-
19 patient will infect

is still 
above one in both eastern and western Washington, meaning the number 
of cases is still increasing.
 
 
Transmis
sion is slowing in Yakima County, an encouraging sign that 
interventions like wearing face coverings can be effective. However, 

-
40 
percent from its peak number of cases. The county mus
t continue to strictly 
follow the measures put in place to slow the spread of the disease to avoid 
another increase.
 
The report also estimates the percentage of the population actively 
infected with COVID
-
19 in Snohomish King and Pierce counties, Spokane 
C
ounty and Yakima County. In the Puget Sound area, the percentage of 
the population with COVID
-
19 has reached levels comparable to those 
seen in late March and is increasing. In Spokane County, estimates of this 
percentage are also rapidly increasing. The e
stimates for Yakima County 
are improving compared to previous calculations, but the situation remains 
concerning.
 
The report also summarizes hospitalization trends, which vary across the 
state. King County hospitalization numbers are stable despite increas
ing 
case counts, likely because the bulk of those increases are in people under 
40. Hospitalizations continue to trend upwards in eastern Washington 
except for Yakima County. In particular, Spokane County is experiencing a 
notable uptick in hospitalization
s.

INSLEE REQUESTS EXTE

COVID

19 PANDEMIC RESPONSE
 
Gov. Jay Inslee sent a letter 
today to 
the Trump administration requesting 
an extension of federal authority and 
funding for Washington National 
Guard employment through 
December 31.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The report includes a comparison of new cases by age in six counties. 
Spokane County and Puget Sound are seeing a high frequency of 
infections in younger age groups. While younger people may be less likely 
to get seriously ill, they may still be spreadi
ng the virus to older and more 
vulnerable populations.
 
DOH partners with Bellevue

based Institute for Disease Modeling, Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Microsoft AI for Health 
program to develop this weekly report. More COVID

today to
 
the Trump administration requesting 
an extension of federal authority and funding for Washington National 
Guard employment in support of COVID

The letter reads, in part:
 
"As the number of positive COVID
-
19 cases continues to climb in our state, 
it is clear that help from the Washington National Guard remains essential 
through the end of the yea
r... Currently, more than 1,000 Citizen
-
Soldiers 
and Airmen are assisting with critical missions that keep our food banks 
operational and our neighbors fed. They are critical to our efforts to slow 
the spread of the virus by supporting COVID
-
mapping missio
ns, assembling 
test kits, and operating community
-
based test sites. Additionally, uniquely 
skilled National Guard planners are assisting my COVID
-
19 food security 
team and other state agencies to ensure that we meet the health and 
welfare needs of Washingt
onians through our phased re
-
opening plan."
 
To date, the Washington National Guard has delivered more than 1.3 
million meals or 33.5 million pounds of food to struggling families at food 
banks across the state, tested over 14,000 people at community
-
based 
testing sites, and built more than 150,000 test kits.

Lessons From the 1918 Pandemic Revisited During COVID

19 
Crisis
 
As COVID
-
19 cases begin to rise again in Washington state and many 
locations around the U.S., fresh attention is being paid to the influenza 
pandemic of 1918, and the l
essons learned during that hard time. There 
was no vaccine or other effective treatment against the
 
1918 virus. Cases 
spiked repeatedly across much of three years. There was unrest over the 
impacts of non
-
pharmaceutical interventions, including public heal
th 
orders that required people to wear masks and other face covers and to 
engage in social distancing. Before it was over, an estimated 50 million 
people died worldwide.
 
The state Department of Health
 
published a blog
 
last week detailing what 
it sees as the top three lessons from the 1918 pandemic. They include:

Training Sessions
 
On Friday, July 10, the Washington State Department of Health became 
aware tha
t we may have sent COVID
-
19
-
related text messages and emails 
in error.
 
While training staff on a new data
-
sharing platform for case investigations 
and contact tracing, we neglected to disable the ability for texts and 
emails to leave the test environment. 
The result is that randomly created 
phone numbers and emails,
 
with no connection to public health data
, may 
have received messages between late May and early July.
 
The number of 
texts and emails sent in error is less than 50.
 
Once we discovered this error,
 
we identified which of the random emails 
and phone numbers could have actually received a message. This 
afternoon, we sent a follow
-
up message about the errors, asking people to 
disregard any text or email they received. We also
 
provided a webpage
 
with more information and an email address for any follow
-
up questions 
they mig
ht have.
 
We deeply regret any inconvenience or worry we may have caused. This 
error does not accurately reflect the high standards we have for our 
training programs or for our vitally important case investigation and 
contact tracing work.

Microsoft Launches Initiative to Help 25 Million People 
Worldwide Acquire the Digital Skills Needed in a COVID
-
19 
Economy
 
Around the world, 2020 has emerged as one of the most challenging years 
in many of our lifetimes. In six months, the world has endured multiple 
challenges, including a pandemic that has spurred a global economic 

hat the economy in July will not be 
what it was in January. Increasingly, one of the key steps needed to foster 
a safe and successful economic recovery is expanded access to the 
digital skills needed to fill new jobs. And one of the keys to a genuinely 
inc
lusive recovery are programs to provide easier access to digital skills for 
people hardest hit by job losses, including those with lower incomes, 
women, and underrepresented minorities.
 
To help address this need, Microsoft is launching a global skills init
iative 
aimed at bringing more digital skills to 25 million people worldwide by the 
end of the year. This initiative will bring together every part of the 
company, combining existing and new resources from LinkedIn, GitHub, 
and Microsoft. It will be grounde
d in three areas of activity:
 
1.
 
The use of data to identify in
-
demand jobs and the skills needed 
to fill them;
 
2.
 
Free access to learning paths and content to help people 
develop the skills these positions require;
 
3.
 
Low
-
cost certifications and free job
-
seeking t
ools to help people 
who develop these skills pursue new jobs.

      Snohomish County™s Isolation and Quarantine Facility Opens Next Week
  SNOHOMISH
 COUNTY,
 Wash.,
 Œ Snohomish County will 
open a COVID
-19 isolation and quarantine site 
next week at the Angel of the Winds Arena in downtown Everett.
  This facility will provide a site for 
temporary isolation and quarantine for those who may not be able to recover in their own home or who 
are amo
ng the county™s unsheltered population. Such individuals who have COVID
-19 would remain in 
isolation there until they are no longer contagious (e.g., 1
-2 weeks), and those who were exposed but 
not ill would be quarantined until having passed through the 14
-day incubation period.
  The primary 
mission of the facility is to reduce transmission to the public.
   The site will be a secure facility. Residents there will be directed to stay until released under orders 
issued by the Snohomish Health District. A typi
cal stay would extend from just a few days up to two 
weeks (occasionally longer), depending on the circumstances.
  The Snohomish County Sheriff™s Office 
will oversee 24/7 security at the facility where six commissioned law enforcement officers will monitor
 the building™s perimeter coupled with an additional
 four
-to-seven security guards (depending on daily 
census) 24/7. The security firm is the same the arena normally uses, and they know the facility well
.  ﬁIsolating
 those
 who
 are
 considered
 infectious
 and
 quarantining
 those
 who
 have
 been
 exposed
 and
 may
 become
 infectious
 will
 reduce
 transmission,

 Health
 Officer
 for

h County
 and
 one
 of the
 medical
 officers
 who
 will

 medical
 aspects
 of the

 of the
 facility.
    ﬁWe appreciate Snohomish County™s leadership 
and all of the partners involved with a project of this 
scope,ﬂ said Dr. Chris Spitters, Health Officer for Snohomish County. ﬁI™m delighted that Dr. Goldbaum 
has stepped up to lend his public health and medical expertise to Snohomish County™s COVID
-19 
res
ponse in this unprecedented time of need.ﬂ
  
ﬁWe must come together as a community to ensure we are controlling the spread of COVID
-19,ﬂ said 
Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers. ﬁSimilar facilities may be necessary across the county and we 
appreciate th
e City of Everett™s willingness to do their part to help control the spread of this pandemic.ﬂ

     There will be a media availability (via

   For Immediate Release
  Statement
  May 4, 2020
  For the last few months, the world has been faced with a widespread, deadly pandemic that 
required quick and 
decisive leadership. Since the first COVID
-19 case was reported in 
Snohomish County in January, the Governor and regional partners have shown just such 
leadership. We led the nation going into the crisis, and now other states look to Washington as 
an examp
le. We used to have more COVID
-19 cases than anywhere else in the country, we™ve 
now stabilized transmission rates. The success of the Stay Home, Stay Healthy order is self
-evident: our health care systems continue to function well; infection rates appear 
to have 

peaked; and we are effectively flattening the curve. Most importantly, we are saving lives. The 
support and participation of our residents has played a huge role in this success, and we thank 
them for the changes they™ve made in their lives and wor
k for the good of our community.
  We have lost over 100 souls to this virus, and we will lose more. The question is how many? 
Each was a person with a name, a life, a family and friends, and one of our neighbors. 
Everything we have been asked to do is to s
ave lives, to ensure that the sick get the care they 
need, to buy time for treatments, and to hopefully develop a vaccine.
   
Our work is not done, however, and it is imperative that we hold steady and sustain this 

positive momentum. The Governor™s announce
ment on Friday extends the timeline for us all to 
Stay Home, Stay Healthy, outlines the conditions that must be achieved for additional 

restrictions to be lifted, and sets forth a reasonable, phased approach for us to re
-open our 
communities. We support th
is science
-based, data
-driven plan and remain committed to 
supporting the implementation of this next stage of response. We appreciate the Governor 
providing a helpful roadmap and relevant details on the phases of reopening, since it helps us 
and our busin
ess owners have the information we need to make plans for re
-opening.
    
This public health crisis has been very difficult for our communities. Our residents, workers, and 
businesses have all been tremendously impacted. We™ve rolled up our sleeves and are 
continuing to work with our community partners to get our economy up and running again. We 
look forward to working together with our businesses, non
-profits
, and governmental partners 
on plans to restore vitality to our cities and county. Together, we will
 get through this.

New SHD Blog Post: Working Toward Phase 3 of a Safe Start for 
Snohomish County
 
The Snohomish Health District (SHD) published a new blog post discussing 
why Snohomish County is not currently in a posit
ion to apply for Phase 3, 
indicating that there are specific metrics the county must meet to be 
considered for approval by the state for Phase 3. These include case rate 
per 100,000 residents, case investigation and contact tracing, and testing. 
As of the 
last two
-
week reporting period for this data (
June 2 to 16
), we are 
not meeting several of those metrics.
 

 
While our case rate was below 
the limit of 25 per 100,000 for a 
few weeks, we have recently seen an increase. For the period of 
June 2 to 16, the rate went up from about 22 per 100,000 to 23.6 

 

 
Testing levels should be 50 tests per 

tests per case.

New Study: Finding Antibodies that Neutralize COVID
-
19
 
The National Institu
tes of Health (NIH) funded a study of nearly 150 people 
who recovered from COVID
-
19. The study, published in the journal Nature, 
shows that most people, in fact, do produce antibodies that can 
effectively neutralize COVID
-
19. But there is a catch: 99% of t


immune response.
 
The good news is that when researchers looked at individuals who 
mounted a strong immune response, they were able to identify three 
antibodies that were e
xtremely effective at neutralizing COVID
-
19. By 
mass
-
producing copies of these antibodies as so
-
called
 
monoclonal 
antibodies
, the researchers can now better evaluate their potential as 

antibodies, or not enough of them.

CDC Launches New Webpage: Food & COVID
-

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
launched a new 
webpage to address food and COVID

19. The CDC advises that 
coronaviruses, like the one that causes COVID
-
19, are thought to spread 
mostl
y 
person
-
to
-
person
 
through respiratory droplets when someone 
coughs, sneezes, or talks. It is possible that a person can get
 
COVID
-
19 by 
touching a surface or object, including food or food packaging, that has 
the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their 
eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the
 
virus spreads
. 
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that handling food or consuming 
food is associated with COVID
-
19.

Minimizing the Effects of Wildfire Smoke During
 
COVID
-
19
 
The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), under FEMA, encourages communities 
to take actionable
 
steps to minimize the respiratory 
effects
 
of wildfire 
smoke. Wildfire smoke occurring during the COVID
-
19 pandemic can 
increase susceptibility to the virus and other infections by causing irritation 
to the respiratory system, resulting in altered immune function.
 
Populations 
vulnerable to 
smoke,
 
including those with compromised immune systems, 
children under 18, pregnant women, adults 65 and over, and outdoor 
workers need to be
 
aware of this risk.
