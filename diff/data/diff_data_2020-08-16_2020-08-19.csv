891,This month the state Department of Health issued a decision tree to guide local heath officers in making decisions about schools.,pierce,Washington
892,It outlines thresholds for when to consider in-person learning in a community.,pierce,Washington
893,"When the community transmission of disease drops below 75 total cases per 100,000 population over a 14-day period AND the test positivity rate is below 5%, schools can consider in-person learning for elementary students then gradually add hybrid in-person learning for middle or high school students.",pierce,Washington
894,Pierce County is far above those numbers right now.,pierce,Washington

900,"However, once disease transmission drops to the level where schools can return to in-person learning, all schools will need a safety plan so they can open safely.",pierce,Washington
