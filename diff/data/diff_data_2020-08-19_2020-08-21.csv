Initial Fall School Reopening Guidance On June 25, 2020, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts released its Initial Fall School Reopening Guidance.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1694,"View Initial Fall School Reopening Guidance (Mass.gov) Health and safety requirements and related guidance for in-person learning The following is an excerpt from the Initial Fall School Reopening Guidance released on June 25, 2020 by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: At this time, these are the health and safety practices that will enable the safe reopening of schools for in-person learning this fall.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1695,These requirements will be modified as needed during the summer and into the fall.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1696,"In addition to required practices, we have also included guidance on best practices where applicable.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1697,"As general background, COVID-19 spreads when people are in relatively close proximity, through respiratory droplets generated through coughing, sneezing, or talking to an infected person.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1698,"Among the most effective preventive measures – when used consistently and in combination – are masks/face coverings, physical distancing, handwashing, and cleaning frequently touched surfaces.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1699,"[i] Masks/face coverings: As the primary route of transmission for COVID-19 is respiratory,[ii] [iii] [iv] masks or face coverings are among the most critical components of risk reduction.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1700,"[v] [vi] [vii] Masks/face coverings protect the general public against COVID-19 infection,[viii] with a recent retrospective study estimating near 80% effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 transmission, especially when worn prior to symptom onset.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1701,"[ix] In the United States, states advising face masks/face coverings be worn in public saw a decline in their COVID-19 growth rates,[x] and community-wide mask/face covering usage contributed to control of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1702,"[xi] At this time, our initial requirements and related guidance are as follows: Students in grade 2 and above are required to wear a mask/face covering that covers their nose and mouth.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1703,Students in kindergarten and grade 1 should be encouraged to wear a mask/face covering.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1704,"[xii] Face shields may be an option for those students with medical, behavioral, or other challenges who are unable to wear masks/face coverings.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1705,Transparent masks may be the best option for both teachers and students in classes for deaf and hard of hearing students.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1706,They may also be useful for teachers and younger students who rely on visual / facial cues.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1707,"Adults, including educators and staff, are required to wear masks/face coverings.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1708,"Exceptions to mask/face covering requirements must be made for those for whom it is not possible due to medical conditions, disability impact, or other health or safety factors.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1709,Mask breaks should occur throughout the day.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1710,[xiii] Breaks should occur when students can be six feet apart and ideally outside or at least with the windows open.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1711,"Further guidance on mask breaks including duration and frequency will be forthcoming, as well as more information about properly removing and putting on masks.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1712,"Masks/face coverings should be provided by the student/family, but extra disposable face masks should be made available by the school for students who need them.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1713,Reusable masks/face coverings provided by families should be washed by families daily.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1714,Districts and schools with families experiencing financial hardship and unable to afford masks/face coverings should endeavor to provide masks for students through grant funds described earlier in this document.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1715,Masks/face coverings are required to be worn by everyone on the bus during school bus transportation.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1716,"Transparent face coverings provide the opportunity for more visual cues and should be especially considered as an alternative for younger students, students who are deaf and hard of hearing, and their teachers.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1717,Physical distancing: Physical distancing is another important practice that helps mitigate transmission of the virus.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1718,"While the U.S. federal CDC has recommended maintaining a physical distance of six feet between individuals,[xiv] the World Health Organization’s guidance states approximately three feet.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1719,"[xv] There is no precise threshold for safety; indeed, studies suggest that physical distancing of three feet or more leads to reduced transmission, with additional distance providing additional protection.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1720,"[xvi] [xvii] For instance, in a study of household transmission in China, keeping at least three feet of distance was associated with one-fourth the number of transmissions.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1721,[xviii] It is important to note that six feet distancing is emphasized in public health advisories especially when no mask/face covering is worn.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1722,We encourage districts and schools to aim for six feet of distance between individuals where feasible.,cambridge,Massachusetts
1723,"At the same time, a minimum physical distance of three feet has been established when combined with the other measures outlined in this list of safety requirements.",cambridge,Massachusetts
1724,"Because of the reduced susceptibility in children and lower apparent rates of transmission, establishing a minimum physical distance of three feet is informed by evidence and balances the lower risk of COVID-19 transmission and the overarching benefits of in-person school.",cambridge,Massachusetts
