3107,Close contacts to a person with contagious COVID-19 are at risk of getting sick.,ingham,Michigan
3108,They must be identified and be quarantined.,ingham,Michigan
3109,What is a close contact?,ingham,Michigan
3110,"For COVID-19, a close contact is most often someone that has been within 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) of an infected person for at least 15 minutes, with or without a face covering.",ingham,Michigan
3111,"Every case is different, however, and the health department has to look at how COVID-19 is spread and how we get infected when figuring out close 6 | P age RETURN TO SCHOOL TOOLKIT August 21, 2020 contacts.",ingham,Michigan
3112,The health department helps determine close contacts every day and routinely investigates contacts to many types of contagious diseases.,ingham,Michigan
3113,Examples of Close Contacts in the Schools Many things affect what a close contact is and this needs to be determined on a case by case basis by the local health department.,ingham,Michigan
3114,"However, at a minimum, the following examples should apply to most situations.",ingham,Michigan
3115,"Assuming all COVID-19 prevention methods have been followed (everyone has been consistently and properly using face coverings, washing hands frequently, cleaning frequently touched items often, maintaining physical distancing as best as possible, not sharing items, etc.",ingham,Michigan
3116,"), a close contact might be: • If the contagious individual were a teacher: adults tend to be more contagious.",ingham,Michigan
3117,"If the contagious teacher was not keeping at least 6* feet away from students while teaching (i.e., walking around while lecturing, doing a lot of one on one, face to face instruction), the entire class might need to be on quarantine.",ingham,Michigan
3118,"o If the teacher is not wearing appropriate face covering, the spread of droplets and aerosol is greater.",ingham,Michigan
3119,"• Classmates sitting or often within 6* feet of the contagious individual, either in the classroom or on the bus, unless it only occurred one time and was less than 15 minutes.",ingham,Michigan
3120,o This would typically be the one to two rows of students sitting closest to the contagious individual.,ingham,Michigan
3121,• Lunchmates of student if sitting within 6* feet of contagious individual.,ingham,Michigan
3122,o This is a higher risk time as face coverings cannot be worn.,ingham,Michigan
3123,"• Playmates on the playground or in gym within 6* feet of the contagious individual unless interactions are consistently kept very brief, no common items are shared, and locker room time is not shared.",ingham,Michigan
3124,"• Sports teammates within 6* feet of the contagious individual unless interactions are consistently kept very brief, no common items are shared, and locker room time is not shared.",ingham,Michigan
3125,"• Opposing teammates in sporting events that shared time on the field or court with the contagious individual unless it can be confirmed that there were no potential interactions within 6* feet between the contagious individual and specific teammates from the opposing team and no contact with shared items • Classmates or others that had interactions with the contagious individual lasting over 15 minutes in confined areas such as bathrooms, office room, where distancing of 6* feet is difficult.",ingham,Michigan
3126,• Any other person outside of school that had similar exposure to a contagious individual is considered a close contact.,ingham,Michigan
3127,*Public health authorities may determine that distances beyond 6 feet can still result in high-risk exposures based on other considerations and circumstances in each particular case.,ingham,Michigan
3128,It will be very helpful for parents to keep note of where their student is going and who they are spending time with outside of school.,ingham,Michigan
3129,This will help greatly in finding close contacts should someone become infected.,ingham,Michigan

3218,They are little flecks of spit.,ingham,Michigan
3219,Respiratory droplets tend to settle out of the air after traveling several feet from the person that released them.,ingham,Michigan
3220,"Respiratory droplets can also spread directly by kissing or sharing personal items like drinks, vape pens, silverware, or other things that go from one person’s mouth to another.",ingham,Michigan
3221,"We can reduce the spread of droplets to each other by wearing face coverings, avoiding large crowded groups, and staying more than 6 feet apart from each other.",ingham,Michigan
3222,"Aerosols Aerosols are even smaller particles that are created when we breathe, talk, sing, sneeze, or cough.",ingham,Michigan
3223,They are lighter and can stay in the air much longer than respiratory droplets but dry up more quickly.,ingham,Michigan
3224,We can reduce the spread of aerosols by increasing outdoor air ventilation or filtering air that is being recirculated.,ingham,Michigan
3225,"Objects Objects can spread the COVID-19 virus when respiratory droplets or aerosols settle on them, leaving germs behind or if someone has the COVID-19 virus on their hands from touching their nose or mouth then touches an object.",ingham,Michigan
3226,COVID-19 appears to stay on objects for up to one to three days.,ingham,Michigan
