4879,"The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT approached the Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) and offered to manage and conduct COVID-19 surveillance testing of all residents, health care workers, and staff at skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities in Cambridge.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4880,Why is this program being launched in Cambridge skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities?,cambridge,Massachusetts
4881,The risk associated with COVID-19 to residents in skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities is extremely high.,cambridge,Massachusetts
4882,"While the Cambridge Public Health Department expects that skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities in Cambridge are following Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines (found here) and/or best practices, staff at these facilities are under intense pressure at this time.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4883,"Rapid testing for all patients/residents, health care workers, and staff will provide timely information about COVID-19 status that skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities are currently unable to obtain due to limited availability of testing.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4884,Surveillance testing at this time is critical for the continued control and prevention of COVID-19 at these facilities where many residents are at high risk for serious illness and death from COVID- 19.,cambridge,Massachusetts
4885,What is the benefit of conducting surveillance testing?,cambridge,Massachusetts
4886,"Surveillance testing, which is what this pilot project is undertaking, is a different approach from how most COVID-19 testing is currently being conducted in the United States at this time.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4887,"Under the surveillance approach, everyone in a given population—in this case, those who live and work in skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities—is tested for COVID-19, regardless of whether they have symptoms or feel ill.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4888,This approach will provide a more accurate picture of the true infection rate in skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities at a given point in time.,cambridge,Massachusetts
4889,"By testing an entire population of facility patients/residents and workers, regardless of symptoms, the Cambridge Public Health Department and state partners can move quickly to isolate residents.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4890,The goal of rapid identification of positive cases is to break the chain of transmission in these facilities and ultimately reduce the number of people who become infected.,cambridge,Massachusetts
4891,Who is conducting the tests?,cambridge,Massachusetts
4892,"The Broad Institute has procured testing supplies and conducted a brief “train the trainers” program for testing process, packaging/labeling, and delivery procedures for Pro EMS field staff.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4893,Each screening day is being conducted by three teams of six field providers plus a team leader all in appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) provided by Pro EMS.,cambridge,Massachusetts

4895,TESTING & PUBLIC DISCLOSURE Will the Broad Institute publicly report the number of positive tests in these facilities?,cambridge,Massachusetts
4896,The Broad Institute will share the testing data with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Cambridge Public Health Department.,cambridge,Massachusetts
4897,"As test results become available for facility residents, health care workers, and staff, the Cambridge Public Health Department will post a daily case count on the city’s COVID-19 data web page: https://www.cambridgema.gov/covid19/casecount.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4898,This information will be provided in aggregate for all skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities in Cambridge.,cambridge,Massachusetts

4902,No.,cambridge,Massachusetts

4905,The Broad Institute plans on conducting a second round of testing at the end of this week (week of April 13).,cambridge,Massachusetts
4906,What are the next steps to protect patients/residents and workers?,cambridge,Massachusetts
4907,The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has been alerted about the test results.,cambridge,Massachusetts
4908,"The Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) is working with the facilities to provide guidance on “cohorting” patients, which means putting those who have tested positive together and those who have tested negative together and apart from the 2 positive cases.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4909,CPHD is also providing strategies for crisis staffing as guided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).,cambridge,Massachusetts
4910,"If I have family in one of these facilities, can I get tested?",cambridge,Massachusetts
4911,"The pilot will test only residents/patients, staff, and health care workers at these facilities.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4912,"If a healthcare worker or staff member at one of these facilities tests positive, will their family members be tested?",cambridge,Massachusetts
4913,Anyone who tests positive will be given medical instruction appropriate to their condition and in accordance with public health recommendations.,cambridge,Massachusetts
4914,"Family (or other household) members of a worker who has tested positive for COVID-19 should monitor their own health and call their health care provider if they develop symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, cough, and/or shortness of breath).",cambridge,Massachusetts
4915,"If this testing capacity exists, why can’t people in Cambridge who are symptomatic get tested?",cambridge,Massachusetts
4916,"This project is focused on skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities because COVID-19 poses a high risk of serious illness and death to people living in skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities, and can spread easily among residents and staff at these institutions.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4917,"If you have symptoms of COVID-19—which include fever, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, cough, and/or shortness of breath—call your healthcare provider and tell them about your symptoms and your exposure.",cambridge,Massachusetts

4921,"Could this program be expanded elsewhere in Cambridge, such as at the War Memorial Temporary Emergency Shelter?",cambridge,Massachusetts
4922,"While the COVID-19 rapid testing program is currently only being piloted at Cambridge skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities, the City of Cambridge has put in place a number of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at the War Memorial temporary emergency shelter.",cambridge,Massachusetts
4923,This includes separating residents in quarantine who are awaiting test results and transporting any residents who test positive to a separate state-run location.,cambridge,Massachusetts
4924,"Additionally, all residents of the Field House at the temporary emergency shelter are screened prior to entering.",cambridge,Massachusetts

5168,"These viruses spread through coughing or sneezing, much like the flu.",larimer,Colorado
5169,Some coronaviruses are common and regularly cause illness in the U.S. in the fall and winter.,larimer,Colorado

5172,"If they feel feverish or develop cough or difficulty breathing during the self-observation period, they should take their temperature, self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether a medical evaluation is needed.Self-monitoring means people should monitor themselves for fever by taking their temperatures twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing.",larimer,Colorado
5173,"If they feel feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing during the self-monitoring period, they should self-isolate, limit contact with others, and seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider or their local health department to determine whether a medical evaluation is needed.Active monitoring means that the state or local public health authority assumes responsibility for establishing regular communication with potentially exposed people to assess for the presence of fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.",larimer,Colorado
5174,"For people with high-risk exposures, CDC recommends this communication occurs at least once each day.",larimer,Colorado
5175,"The mode of communication can be determined by the state or local public health authority and may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.Close contact is defined as being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case.Contact tracing is the process of public health identifying close contacts of a case of a communicable disease, including COVID-19, to identify any additional cases as early as possible to reduce additional exposures to an illness.",larimer,Colorado
5176,"Public health routinely conducts contact tracing for many communicable diseases including HIV, varicella (chickenpox), measles, and other illnesses.Public health orders are legally enforceable directives issued under the authority of a relevant federal, state, or local entity that, when applied to a person or group, may place restrictions on the activities undertaken by that person or group, potentially including movement restrictions or a requirement for monitoring by a public health authority, for the purposes of protecting the public’s health.",larimer,Colorado
5177,"Federal, state, or local public health orders may be issued to enforce isolation and/or quarantine.Isolation means the separation of a person or group of people known or believed to have a communicable disease and who are potentially infectious from those who do not have the disease to prevent the spread of the communicable disease.",larimer,Colorado
5178,"Isolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order.Quarantine in general means the separation of a person or group of people reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease but not yet symptomatic, from others who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the communicable disease.Congregate settings are crowded public places where close contact with others may occur, such as shopping centers, movie theaters, stadiums.Social/physical distancing means remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible.How did the COVID-19 outbreak begin?On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials alerted the World Health Organization of several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China.",larimer,Colorado
5179,The pneumonia was caused by a virus that did not match any other known virus.,larimer,Colorado

5192,"Like any other virus, no identity, community, ethnic, or racial group is more at risk for getting or spreading COVID-19.",larimer,Colorado
5193,"At this time, risk is based on recent travel to China and close contact with someone who is sick with COVID-19.",larimer,Colorado
5194,"What can I do to protect myself and my family from COVID-19?People who are worried about this, or any respiratory virus, like the flu, can protect themselves by practicing everyday actions:Do I need a facemask?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering to reduce the risk of unknowingly spreading the virus to others.",larimer,Colorado
