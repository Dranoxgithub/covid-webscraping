Public Health officials with the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment (LCDHE) understand that there is fear and confusion around coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). LCDHE reminds the community that the risk of COVID-19 in Colorado is low, and there are currently no cases in Larimer County or in Colorado.  LCDHE is always working behind the scenes to plan for these types of health threats to our community.
Multiple responses to emerging pathogens in the last few years have prepared public health to respond to situations like this. Work has been done for SARS, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, MERS, and many others. Local public health agencies are working closely with CDC, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and organizations across the state to ensure our response is proactive, strong, and collaborative.
“The Larimer County Health Department has pandemic response plans ready to go, tools and protocols in place to monitor travelers and other individuals who may be exposed, and the infection control expertise we need to respond to COVID-19,” says Tom Gonzales, Public Health Director for the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment.

Information about COVID-19 is constantly changing, and the public health response adjusts as more is learned about this virus. While there is plenty of news and media information available, LCDHE is encouraging Larimer County residents to view the latest credible information onCOVID-19 at www.larimer.org/coronavirus  or www.CDC.gov/coronavirus. Additionally, residents are encouraged to follow LCDHE’s Facebook and Twitter accounts at @LarimerHealth.
