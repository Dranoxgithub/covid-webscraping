,"This approach reduces the risk of COVID-19 to Washington’s most vulnerable populations and preserves capacity in our health care system, while safely opening up businesses and resuming gatherings, travel, shopping, and recreation.",kitsap,Washington

,"COVID-19 DISEASE ACTIVITY Before reopening Washington and modifying physical distancing measures, COVID-19 disease burden must be low and decreasing as measured by: Number and trend of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Washington State Modeling data, including Institute for Disease Modeling on Puget Sound area rates of COVID-19 spread, University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation modeling, and Youyang Gu modeling Mobility trends in Washington State, including WSDOT traffic data and Google Mobility Data READINESS AND CAPABILITIES NEEDED The Department of Health and local public health officials will monitor data to assess our state’s readiness for safely reopening and modifying physical distancing measures.",kitsap,Washington

,All Washingtonians have a responsibility to protect themselves and others.,kitsap,Washington
,"Each phase, while allowing for additional services to open and return to full capacity, is grounded in the following required basic practices: Guidance for Individuals All phases – Individuals should continue to: • Engage in physical distancing, staying at least six feet away from other people • Wear cloth face coverings in public places when not eating or drinking (cloth face coverings should not be placed on children younger than 2 years of age, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance) • Stay home if sick • Avoid others who are sick • Wash hands frequently with soap and water (use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available) • Cover coughs and sneezes • Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands • Disinfect surfaces and objects regularly Requirements for All Employers All phases – Employers are required to: • Maintain the six-foot physical distancing requirements for employees and patrons.",kitsap,Washington

,Follow CDC cleaning guidelines to deep clean after reports of an employee with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 illness.,kitsap,Washington
,This may involve the closure of the business until the location can be properly disinfected.,kitsap,Washington
