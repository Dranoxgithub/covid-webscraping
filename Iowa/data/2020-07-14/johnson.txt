 How does contact tracing work?When a Johnson County resident has a confirmed positive COVID-19 test, Johnson County Public Health is notified by the Iowa Department of Public Health. Our team of investigators and contact tracers reaches out to the person who tested positive and anyone who has had an exposure to them. If someone has had an exposure we directly contact them or we can also coordinate with employers to determine other staff who were exposed. Since people who test positive for COVID-19 should inform their employers, the employer often reaches out to us for guidance. An exposure is currently defined as being less than six feet away from someone for longer than 15 minutes during their infectious period.Have I been exposed to COVID-19?If you’ve been around someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 for longer than 15 minutes and less than six feet away from them during their infectious period, Johnson County Public Health would consider this as an exposure and that you are a close contact.  When is someone infectious?A person is infectious 48 hours before they start showing symptoms. For those who are asymptomatic (without any symptoms), they are considered infectious for 48 hours before they took their test.If I test positive, what do I do?Stay home, isolated from others, even those in your household, for 10 days. You will be released from isolation 10 days from the time of symptom onset, or if asymptomatic (without any symptoms) from the day you received your test. You also need to be fever-free for three days, with symptoms improving.  If I’ve been exposed (been around a person who tested positive for more than 15 minutes and less than feet away from them), what do I do?Quarantine yourself at home, away from others – even those in your household – for 14 days. We ask you to remain isolated so that if you become sick, you will not have exposed others while waiting for the 14 days to lapse or illness to develop. You are not considered contagious at this time, so other people in your household do not need to worry or quarantine themselves. Those who are not under quarantine can still go to work and leave the home. You should have a COVID-19 test between days 11 to 13 of your quarantine. A negative test earlier in quarantine will not allow early release. A negative test at any point during quarantine does not mean that you will remain free of infection. It only means the virus was not detected on the day that testing took place.Can Public Health close down a place because of COVID-19?Johnson County Public Health does not have the authority to close any facilities due to COVID-19.  There are currently no state or local laws governing business closures due to COVID-19 but some local businesses have decided to close on their own – maybe because they have staff who are ill, are taking necessary precautions, or they’re being thoughtfully cautious at this time.  Remember there is community spread of this virus, so you should be protecting yourself and others everywhere you decide to go.

   Call your doctor if you develop symptoms and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, or have recently traveled from an area with widespread/ongoing community spread of COVID-19.






   
What You Can Do to Prevent Illness
There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person:Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.


  Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. Please consult with your health care provider about additional steps you may be able to take to protect yourself.



   Take Steps to Protect Yourself and Others

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

Frequently Asked Questions



   See also Johnson County's COVID-19 FAQ.See also the CDC's general COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FAQ.



   






What is a novel coronavirus?
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.









What is the source of the virus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.









Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.









What should healthcare professionals and health departments do?
See the FAQ for Healthcare Professionals from the CDC for more information.
