DONATE TO THE EMERGENCY CHILDCARE FUND HEREAn Emergency Childcare Collaborative in Pottawattamie County has been formed to address the childcare needs of 
first responders, medical providers, and other essential workers
 who continue to serve our communities during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The emergency closing of schools and some day care centers have left many members of our public safety and health systems teams without childcare. The Collaborative is making free, daytime childcare available to those who do not currently have it during the school closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.The collaborative is now seeking to expand services to additional Essential Services Industries throughout Council Bluffs and Pottawattamie County. If your company falls within the categories identified in the graphic below, have your employees 
fill out the survey
 
so the community needs can be assessed and employees registered for the program, as needed. This program is intended to serve members of the public safety, healthcare, and other essential services who have not daycare available to them. As resources are limited during this pandemic, the Emergency Childcare Collaborative Program is not intended to replace existing daycare for member employees. ALL Employees should 1) work with their existing provider if they are still operating; 2) try to make arrangements with family, friends, and neighbors, or 3) ask your employer if they are participating in this initiative once all other options have been exhausted.

We ask for your donation to help us continue and grow this program to meet the needs of those we need the most.
