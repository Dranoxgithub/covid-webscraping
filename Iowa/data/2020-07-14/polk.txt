                        Our country has seen an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations over the past several weeks. The United States has experienced the highest case counts of the pandemic, over 40,000 cases in the past two days.  Central Iowa is now following the same trend. Over the past seven days, our positive COVID-19 cases are on the rise again. Since the beginning of June, Polk County has been averaging around 50-55 cases a day. The seven-day trend has shown an increase of 20% of new cases reported in central Iowa. We are seeing community spread of COVID-19 as our community has re-opened.

                        Over the past three months, infant deaths have been on the rise in Polk County. From April to June 2020, the Polk County Medical Examiner autopsied seven babies. Five out of the seven deaths occurred in unsafe sleep environments. This is a stark contrast from January to March 2020, where there was only one infant death related to natural disease.

.MumpsWe continue to see cases of mumps in Iowa.  We can help to slow the spread by being alert for symptoms of mumps.  After exposure to mumps, symptoms typically appear 16 – 18 days after infection but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection.  Some people who get mumps may have very mild or no symptoms and may not know they have the disease.  The most common mumps symptoms are fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and swollen and tender salivary glands under the jaw (on one or both sides).Anyone with mumps symptoms should contact their health care provider.  Laboratory tests should be requested for anyone with mumps symptoms without other apparent cause, regardless of vaccination history.

A message from the 211 medical triage call centerOn behalf of the Polk County Health Department, United Way 211 and the hospital systems and clinics in the county, we want to thank all the nurses who donated their time answering the 211 medical triage line. Nurses from hospitals, clinics and schools along with medical students answered phones seven days a week responding to individuals concerned about their exposure to COVID-19, symptoms of the illness, how to get tested along with many other questions and concerns. When our hospitals and clinics were taxed, the nurses and medical students stepped up and provided guidance to aid the health and well-being of our community. We will be forever grateful for your service.United Way 211 and Polk County have always had a successful partnership during uncertain and often difficult times. The COVID-19 pandemic has not been any different.  The collaboration between 211, Polk County Medical Coordination Center, Polk County and our hospital systems have helped thousands of people in our community navigate their health care to lessen the burden on our medical system and prioritize healthcare needs in the community. 211 took on the medical triage call center without question. They knew it was the time when the community needed help and guidance and they were eager and happy to provide that assistance. We thank United Way 211 for stepping up and handling this momentous task with ease.As our healthcare systems have now adjusted to the ongoing demands surrounding COVID-19 and we have seen the numbers to our 211 medical triage line decrease, we will be winding down that line on Friday, May 22, 2020; however, 211 will still run 24/7 to answer COVID-19 related questions and help connect Iowans to information and resources they need.  We recommend patients contact their medical home regarding medical related COVID-19 questions. For other questions about COVID-19, or for help navigating any other health, human, or social service programs, please call 211.Donate homemade cloth masks!Broadlawns Medical Center

With the Governor moving her press conferences to 11, will this move so as not to conflict?
We will look into this and look for updated information from us.What about individuals who have tested negative yet days later when worse, they test positive. Is this
negative number take out of the total that we keep getting told about?
The negative tests results would remain negative at the point in time the test was conducted the result
was negative. We are unable to discern if the subsequent positive test was an extension of an existing
illness or a subsequent exposure.Governor just announced 102 new cases and 1 new death.Has there been discussion of policy regarding Code Blue by EMS at home of known COVID-19
patients?
At this point, there is not any formal discussion among hospitals right now. We will discuss this with
hospital staff when the surge of patients happens.Can we get greater county level data? For example race, ethnicity and hospitalizations?

 for demographic information.Are there any concerns of contaminated tests in Iowa as health officials are reporting this issue in certain states?We have not seen an issue with this to date in Polk County.Is Polk County/Iowa looking into using contact tracing apps as an addition to the interview being conduction for positive tests?We consider how technology can complement the work we do. There is an absence of research that helps us to know if the apps are effective and efficient. The apps can also be a violation of HIPAA.With you tracking family members and contact tracing them, are they included in numbers? Is the case number a true reflection of the infection rate in Polk County?The numbers of cases are reflected by the number of positive tested in Polk County.  Can you name the congregate facilities being monitored?We cannot release this information as it an ongoing public health investigation and that violates public health laws.  There are facilities that the Governor shares on her website when they reach an outbreak status.How many are being currently asked to quarantine in the state because of potential exposure?We do not have access to that information on states numbers.How many people are being currently served at the fairgrounds? And, how many have been served so far?Iowa law provides that certain information, data and records collected under public health legal authority are confident and may not be disclosed to the public. We know this law is complex and requires approval by the state.

 for demographic information.The governor just announced there will be mass testing at the Iowa Events Center starting Saturday? Is Polk County involved?Polk County EMA is in daily discussions with the State. We have submitted a list of questions and concerns. We are working with the State to address these.It seems like Polk County has the expertise it needs to contact sufficient contract tracing. Two questions: do you get the feeling that other Iowa counties are mastering this task or struggling with it? Question 2: how much money are you spending on the county’s COVID response, including contact tracing?Polk County has the expertise and the expert team to do this work but the sheer volume of positive cases is overwhelming our ability to do that. With Test Iowa coming online and up to 750 additional tests per day that would be going through the county at some time, it was no longer feasible for us to do this. The State has asked whether to turn the cases in to the county or to keep working on them. We know the majority of the counties have turned their cases over to the state.Question 2: Difficult question to answer at this point. Keith described how county departments are tracking those costs. We are doing everything we can to tie our objectives and the responsibilities we have with the cost to give us the best chance possible of reimbursement under the presidential disaster declaration. We are utilizing grants when possible. The donations have greatly beneficiated our team and community. Secondary benefit – the donations in our system can assign a market value to the donations and that helps offset a cost match under the presidential disaster declaration.How would a health care professional access or refer to the isolation center?Process up until now would come from the Polk County Health Department. The state would provide the county with the records and the county would provide follow up to the patient. The county would take to the patient about isolation and what their options and restrictions were and then make a referral to the shelter. Local providers who have knowledge that a person is positive and experiencing homeless should still go through the Polk County Health Department Communicable Disease team at 286-3890. They will talk through with the provider the same things…if there are any alternatives, medically stable and a positive test. Then the Health Department will work with the shelter on how to transport the person to the shelter. We would like to make sure providers send the patient with appropriate medications.Why isn’t more explanation being given to what we consider underlying conditions in our county and state? Also at what age does elderly begin?COVID-19 is a new disease that we have limited and evolving information regarding the risk factors. The CDC considers elderly people 65 years and older and people of any age who have an underlying health condition that may be at greater risk for severity and illness with COVID-19. A number of those types of conditions are those with chronic lung disease, heart conditions, immunocompromised, etc. The CDC does identify severe obesity of a body mass index of 40 or higher in additional to diabetes, chronic liver disease, kidney disease that can be a risk factor for severe disease with COVID-19. In Polk County, we have not seen a high association between obesity and severe disease but again, this is something that is evolving and we will learn more as we go further and see more illness and analyze illness trends.Seven confirmed cases in the jail. Have there been anymore?No new cases at the jail. We are still at 7 cases.How to wear a mask and how to store and dispose of masks properly? Or have the governor cover this in her daily briefing?A lot of recommendations out there for how to wear a mask. There is CDC guidance that has been shared by the EOC and Polk County Health Department. Visit Polk County website on the proper manufacturing and production of cloth masks and how to wear them.MercyOne was yellow coded for staffing, what exactly does this mean and are they short staffed to the point of impacting care?MercyOne is showing yellow and surging right now. Staffing is also surging a little. When you have more patients, you need more staff. Patient care is not compromised by any means. They do have staffing, its not short staffed. We are just seeing an uptick of what they need at their hospital.IDPH removing guidance for self-isolation if a person travels out of state, does Polk County have any guidance or is this no longer necessary?With widespread community transmission, limiting opportunities for exposure with social distancing and staying home as much as possible, those recommendations are still valid recommendations.Is there an adequate supply of level 3 face masks?Level 3 face mask is a very specific type of face mask. While it may look like a surgical mask, it provides a little bit better protection.  Unfortunately, our donations that we are receiving do not have that they are a level 3 labeled on them when they may be a level 3.  We have an adequate supply of face masks but cannot say there is an adequate supply of level 3.Are some of the PPE donations coming from businesses, and if so, will their personnel be appropriately protected as their business operations resume or continue?We are receiving excess PPE from businesses and not what they would need to protect their staff.Are there any guidelines for summer camps such as a number of children or space or whether or not it should even happen?Refer that question to IDPH and the Governor’s office.How are we monitoring residents in Polk County who are possibly traveling to from other counties that are slowly  are opening?We do not have a mechanism to monitor people who are traveling between open and closed counties. I’ve been told that the meat packers are busing people from closed plants to open plants. Do you know about this and if so, what are we doing about it?Polk County EMA, Dallas County EMA, Polk County Health Department and Dallas County Health Department have worked closely and directly with Tyson and we think that resulted with doing surveillance testing in the last couple of days. We will continue to work with Tyson and anyone else in other situations.How are we going to get tested done for those who may have had the virus as early as December, January or February and didn’t know what the lung infection was. Maybe a number of have it and have the immunity?As Serology tests become available, those test results will tell us who has immunity to the virus and who does not. We do not think there has been any conclusive studies to show how protective the antibody response is to the virus and if you can or cannot get it one or more times.   Are local and country residents being screened and temperature checks? How do you differentiate from allergies and COVID-19?We cannot speak to what the cities are doing. At the county level, employees are being screened and temperature checks. It is very difficult to be able to differentiate between allergies and other respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. That is why our guidance has been to stay away from others if they are having symptoms. People who have known allergies that offers them a baseline that they can determine or not if their symptoms are consistent or not with normal allergy season for them or something above and beyond what they typically experience.Linn County has created a specific county dashboard. Can we do something similar?We can have a discussion between Polk County EMA, Polk County Health Department and Polk County IT to see if this is something they can do.After talking to labs, serology testing can only show there has been exposure to coronavirus and not COVID-19.This is new testing that is coming out so as serology testing is approved, there will be information that accompanies that testing that tells us what information is provided by a positive result and what limitations there may be with that testing.It seems like Polk County has the expertise it needs to contact sufficient contract tracing.

We are seeing reference labs that are starting to utilize this. Healthcare providers have some access to it. We are awaiting if local health departments will be able to access this type of testing through the state. There has been some limited testing we’ve heard for antibodies with some of the mass testing through the businesses. This is evolving and emerging.What is the status of housing and evictions for low-income individuals?On March 20, 2020, the Governor added to her proclamation that no one should be evicted from their residence at this time. If you are hearing of people being evicted, please reach out to the Governor’s Constituent Line at (515) 281-5211.

th

They have put together strong plans to be able to respond to that. We continue to monitor the situation and monitor the status of our hospitals on a daily basis. So this is something we have been planning for in case it should happen.If an organization is aware that an employee has a positive COVID-19 test does the state and local public health do the contact tracing or is the organization responsible? Do employees have to notify their employer of a positive test?The Iowa Department of Public Health for the contact investigation and contact tracing for the positive COVID-19 tests, individuals and cases in Polk County. We encourage employers to take a look at where a positive employee might be, who they may have come in contact with and taking action in terms of cleaning and following guidance that we have on our website to address the positive case.

Individual hospitals on how to allocate the resources they have – staff, and beds. As they need to depend upon other health facilities either within their health system, they can move patients, allocate resources accordingly. As it escalates up between health systems, the hospitals in the metro can work together to distribute patients that best matches the resources available. Then you can move up one step further to a regional surge plan, this would be across the 27 counties that are included in the service area 1A, 1B and 1C. All of those hospitals working together to identify available beds, staff and logistics in a way that makes the most sense to match up the level of care with the resources available. That might me releasing patients or moving patients from a higher level of care to a critical access hospital.PCHD had been doing some contact tracing. Has that all now switched to state contact tracing?  How many currently being traced?The state assumed case contact and contact tracing. There are approximately 1,000 people that are currently being under investigation and contact tracing in process.   And to clarify again - you're preparing to activate those plans?  And if so, when do you anticipate doing so?The plans are prepared as a contingency. Each day the balance and demand of those resources to continue to change. It is a very dynamic process.

Testing is occurring at Test Iowa is different than their providers, reference labs and state hygienic lab.What type of testing has been done at the long term care facilities with a confirmed case but no outbreak? Have all residents been tested? Are we waiting on test results?Testing has been done based on contact tracing among residents and staff. This work has been done closely with the facility and our staff.I remain all too aware of the number of people being refused tests despite having known contact with positive individuals, including a health care worker whose spouse and work colleagues can't get tests, or having significant symptoms and basically being verbally confirmed but told at the Unity Point respiratory clinic that they can't be referred for testing as they are not a health care worker. Could we have some straight talk about how testing is being allocated and how the numbers of "presumed positive" but no testing allowed are being handled? These specific examples are all in Polk County.Testing in Polk County is a little complicated unfortunately. Testing is only more available if you consider Test Iowa more available. Testing is not more available at the healthcare facilities. There is still a shortage and we still have to follow IDPH guidelines if you are using the state hygienic lab and those guidelines are fairly strict. Asymptomatic people would not qualify. You need to have symptoms of COVID-19 to qualify for testing.  Testing guidelines is available on Iowa Department of Public Health’s website. The doctor looks at CDC guidelines and ultimately it is up to the doctor if they want to test you for COVID-19. We have to keep in consideration testing is used for the sickest of the sick. Testing is truly not readily available.A new report shows an increase in cases of more than 70% in Polk County in the last week.  The report calls Polk County/Des Moines one of the top 10 hot spots in the country.  The Governor is expected to announce today further lifting of restrictions in Polk County.  Do you believe this is the time to do so?The information that we shared today is really the prudent way for people to behave. I think that you’re hearing that our businesses are cautious to reopen, we are asking our residents to continue to use the mitigation tactics. Regarding it being the right time, I think what we see in our cases and our hospitalizations, the numbers of COVID-19 in Polk County are still increasing. All the preventative tips we have discussed are still required at this time. Whether a community is allowed to open, we hear the phrase, “just because we can, should we?” We have shared all the up-to-date data that we have so people can make those decisions appropriately.Is the recommendation to check on positive COVID-19 friends/family about the sudden/increased risk of death at home OR about community resources (tracking/follow-up) being overwhelmed?I think there are several reasons for making this recommendation. With COVID-19, we are encouraging people to self-isolate, to stay home to prevent the transmission of this virus and this is putting some distance between people. It is decreasing the opportunity to do things that we normally do in terms of checking on our loves ones. We are stressing the importance of checking on people when we are navigating a time where people are isolating and social distancing to make sure people are doing okay. As numbers of people who are ill with COVID-19 increase, this is a way for all of us to come together especially our more vulnerable populations. We make this recommendation during extreme heat. We need to be checking on others, clients to make sure people are doing okay. This is not an unusual recommendation that we would make.Can you elaborate on the guidance you will be pushing out to long-term care facilities regarding supplies/PPE? We have a list of questions for the vendor vetting process. Those questions will get pushed out as well as guidance to determine if your supply chain is fully function or not. We will also be putting out some guidance what PPE you should have on hand and what quantities. This will vary greatly from facility to facility.Can you clarify whether there is Polk County specific business recovery guidance and where that info can be found?  Or should we still be using the IDPH guidance?  Has IDPH updated guidance since their 4/27 release and if so, where that information can be found?Polk County Guidance can be found here: 
https://www.polkcountyiowa.gov/media/d1fc4wa0/brp-05082020.pdfI like the Strike Teams.  Any update on efforts to lessen the time between when the tests are given and people receive their results?  Many I've seen have been about a week delay for results.A lot of it has to do with the number of tests that a lab has to process at any given time.How many people are on the strike team? What tests are being used? Where are tests processed? Is it aimed at long-term care only or other businesses also? How is the team assigned?Strike teams used for special situations such as a smaller facility that won’t qualify for a state strike team. This organization or business could be at the start of an outbreak or it could be working with a high risk population. We do this like we do in public health if it were for vaccinations or disease testing. Going forward, we will continue to look at this by a case-by-case basis in terms what the need is and what kind of staffing it would take to execute testing.So Test Iowa and hygienic lab running essentially separate processes out of the same lab facility? And little coordination/collaboration?That would be a question directed at state hygienic lab regarding how they are handling al the testing and specimens they are currently testing.Since testing has become more available, do these positives include asymptomatic individuals who qualified to be tested?We are aware there are people who have been tested who are asymptomatic. Testing is occurring at Test Iowa is different than their providers, reference labs and state hygienic lab.What type of testing has been done at the long term care facilities with a confirmed case but no outbreak? Have all residents been tested? Are we waiting on test results?Testing has been done based on contact tracing among residents and staff. This work has been done closely with the facility and our staff.I remain all too aware of the number of people being refused tests despite having known contact with positive individuals, including a health care worker whose spouse and work colleagues can't get tests, or having significant symptoms and basically being verbally confirmed but told at the Unity Point respiratory clinic that they can't be referred for testing as they are not a health care worker. Could we have some straight talk about how testing is being allocated and how the numbers of "presumed positive" but no testing allowed are being handled? These specific examples are all in Polk County.Testing in Polk County is a little complicated unfortunately. Testing is only more available if you consider Test Iowa more available. Testing is not more available at the healthcare facilities. There is still a shortage and we still have to follow IDPH guidelines if you are using the state hygienic lab and those guidelines are fairly strict. Asymptomatic people would not qualify. You need to have symptoms of COVID-19 to qualify for testing.  Testing guidelines is available on Iowa Department of Public Health’s website. The doctor looks at CDC guidelines and ultimately it is up to the doctor if they want to test you for COVID-19. We have to keep in consideration testing is used for the sickest of the sick. Testing is truly not readily available.A new report shows an increase in cases of more than 70% in Polk County in the last week.  The report calls Polk County/Des Moines one of the top 10 hot spots in the country.  The Governor is expected to announce today further lifting of restrictions in Polk County.  Do you believe this is the time to do so?The information that we shared today is really the prudent way for people to behave. I think that you’re hearing that our businesses are cautious to reopen, we are asking our residents to continue to use the mitigation tactics. Regarding it being the right time, I think what we see in our cases and our hospitalizations, the numbers of COVID-19 in Polk County are still increasing. All the preventative tips we have discussed are still required at this time. Whether a community is allowed to open, we hear the phrase, “just because we can, should we?” We have shared all the up-to-date data that we have so people can make those decisions appropriately.Is the recommendation to check on positive COVID-19 friends/family about the sudden/increased risk of death at home OR about community resources (tracking/follow-up) being overwhelmed?I think there are several reasons for making this recommendation. With COVID-19, we are encouraging people to self-isolate, to stay home to prevent the transmission of this virus and this is putting some distance between people. It is decreasing the opportunity to do things that we normally do in terms of checking on our loves ones. We are stressing the importance of checking on people when we are navigating a time where people are isolating and social distancing to make sure people are doing okay. As numbers of people who are ill with COVID-19 increase, this is a way for all of us to come together especially our more vulnerable populations. We make this recommendation during extreme heat. We need to be checking on others, clients to make sure people are doing okay. This is not an unusual recommendation that we would make.Can you elaborate on the guidance you will be pushing out to long-term care facilities regarding supplies/PPE? We have a list of questions for the vendor vetting process. Those questions will get pushed out as well as guidance to determine if your supply chain is fully function or not. We will also be putting out some guidance what PPE you should have on hand and what quantities. This will vary greatly from facility to facility.Can you clarify whether there is Polk County specific business recovery guidance and where that info can be found?  Or should we still be using the IDPH guidance?  Has IDPH updated guidance since their 4/27 release and if so, where that information can be found?Polk County Guidance can be found here:

What happened with this? Is this still being looked at? Is the criteria to get a test being expanded?One of the challenging things as a county is you would like some control over your destiny knowing that Test Iowa is taking a board approach to testing over the test. One of the areas we are exploring is strategic testing and putting in place a model that will serve our community to prevent widespread COVId-19 transmission or a second wave if it was going to occur. That will require additional testing and a system set up to actually to do something with the data once it happens. We are exploring those options at this point and we are in discussion with some Iowa based companies that have the capacity to help us. We feel quite certain we will have guidance to report on in the future. At this point, it is fair to knowledge that we are exploring it fully. It takes thoughtful and meaningful work to set up and make sure it is used effectively.LTC outbreak # quite different from state’s website (Polk 24 vs state 7)—is state only reporting those >10% affected?The Iowa Department of Public Health is reporting long term care facilities with outbreak on their website.

.Last week DHS Director Garcia announced testing would be available for all day care workers and children to support reopening of day cares. However, they are not currently being provided at the day care my granddaughters attend, which has closed two of their rooms for fourteen days due to a child in each testing positive. The day care is begging parents to distance as they say they can't afford to stay open if they have to keep closing rooms. It's concerning to hear that testing is available when that is not even the case for a place that has remained open during this crisis. Do you have insight on testing access, tracing procedures, and information sources for providers and parents?The Department of Human Services is providing guidance for childcare providers. The Iowa Department of Public Health is engaging in case contact and contact tracing for Polk County. Childcare nurse consultants are also available to childcare centers. As we have heard recently, Test Iowa has opened criteria so Test Iowa is available for testing as well. For children and staff of childcare centers, we encourage them to call their healthcare provider for testing. There are a variety of avenues to support childcare centers.

Anyone who is in question if they have been exposed, these are important guidelines to follow. With more availability of testing, that is another avenue to determine if they have COVID-19 and to follow proper guidance in regards to staying home.

https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/For testing reported, is that individuals tested or total tests run? If a person is tested twice, are they counted twice or just once? Just curious for the one out x tested figure.Total tests run. It could be multiple tests for one single person.You are gearing down, but due to openings and protests, cases are likely to increase, how quickly are you able to come back up?We are one email away from a zoom meeting. Most of us are co-located in this building or close by. It is very easy for us to get everyone back together in the EOC virtually if needed.Are we encouraging/assisting facilities (hospitals, LTC, etc.) to start thinking about how they can use non-disposable PPE--e.g. elastomeric respirators, durable face shields, washable gowns/coveralls?  Are there cleaning/disinfecting guidelines and item recommendations?We have been following CDC guidance on reuse of PPE and using non-disposable gowns. We continue to share that guidance and support the use of these items within congregate living. 
Do we know what effects the ongoing protests will have on COVID-19 case numbers? What precautions should protestors take to stay safe? Sorry again if this was already talked about. 
Anytime we see people getting together in large numbers and being in close proximity, we have concerns that we could see the number of cases increase. We continue to echo in regards to any group activity, the importance of staying home when sick. We know particularly people want to come together to share their stories and messages and if they are ill, maybe take to social media to prevent the spread of illness.  Wear masks, use hand sanitizer, maintain social distancing whenever possible. All of this is so important anytime anyone is out in groups.   
Friday's situation report implied some contact tracing being done by Polk Co. again.  Has Polk Co. resumed doing contact tracing for all or just some?Iowa Department of Public Health continues to do individual contacts and case tracing. Polk County Health Department is working with congregate living in terms on contact tracing, testing and providing support. 
With high school athletics restarting, are there any special steps being taken to provide timely support if + cases/exposure arise? 
There is guidance available for high school athletic and sporting events. We encourage the use of that guidance. We continue to do what we do in terms of identifying positive cases and notifying contacts. All of those processes are in place whether at state or local level and they aid in identifying individuals and reducing spread whether it’s at an athletic event, group event or other activities. 
What is the situation at the Polk County jail, and what is the effect of the influx of people being arrested at protests? Are they at risk of catching the virus at the jail?Those who have been detained as a part of the protests are quickly processed and released. There is minimal exposure. There are isolation areas in the jail for those who disclose COVID-19 positive status or are tested positive while at the jail. 
What is the current testing situation in Polk?  Is it easy to get upon request (symptoms or no symptoms) or do there continue to be issues with availability? 
As of right now, the clinics and hospitals still have a tight prioritization list of how they are testing people. Test Iowa is still available for asymptomatic people. The situation remains very fluid and will continue to do so for quite a while. What we are hearing from Test Iowa is that people can schedule out 3 days from the day they schedule their appointment. The testing may not be immediate but it should be within 3 days when you try to schedule. If you can’t get a date that works for you, try again and refill out the questionnaire. 
Where is the guidance for sports teams and what to do if some tests positive?https://www.polkcountyiowa.gov/media/dydi1cer/pchd-athletic-guidance.pdfSeveral companies are offering contact tracing for businesses, what are your thoughts?  Are you currently working with any outside agencies to facilitate contact tracing?The Health Department is not currently working with any outside organizations for contact tracing. Businesses have the opportunity to utilize this service. We recommend to vet these companies and do any appropriate agreements or contracts because we are aware of scams out there.Can the local emergency management and public health agencies encourage the adoption or mandate of paid sick leave or temporary unemployment benefit policies to make "stay at home if you're sick" possible?We can encourage it but we cannot mandate it. That is a private business/sector decision. It is also a legislative decision. It is beyond what public health or emergency management can do.Is there any new advice or updates about safety of swimming pools?  There is nothing new. The CDC continues to put out guidance so continue to visit their website. What is the total recovered cases from the 4,324 cases currently?This information can be found on

Just curious for the one out x tested figure.Total tests run. It could be multiple tests for one single person.You are gearing down, but due to openings and protests, cases are likely to increase, how quickly are you able to come back up?We are one email away from a zoom meeting. Most of us are co-located in this building or close by. It is very easy for us to get everyone back together in the EOC virtually if needed.Are we encouraging/assisting facilities (hospitals, LTC, etc.) to start thinking about how they can use non-disposable PPE--e.g. elastomeric respirators, durable face shields, washable gowns/coveralls?  Are there cleaning/disinfecting guidelines and item recommendations?We have been following CDC guidance on reuse of PPE and using non-disposable gowns. We continue to share that guidance and support the use of these items within congregate living. 
Do we know what effects the ongoing protests will have on COVID-19 case numbers? What precautions should protestors take to stay safe? Sorry again if this was already talked about. 
Anytime we see people getting together in large numbers and being in close proximity, we have concerns that we could see the number of cases increase. We continue to echo in regards to any group activity, the importance of staying home when sick. We know particularly people want to come together to share their stories and messages and if they are ill, maybe take to social media to prevent the spread of illness.  Wear masks, use hand sanitizer, maintain social distancing whenever possible. All of this is so important anytime anyone is out in groups.   
Friday's situation report implied some contact tracing being done by Polk Co. again.  Has Polk Co. resumed doing contact tracing for all or just some?Iowa Department of Public Health continues to do individual contacts and case tracing. Polk County Health Department is working with congregate living in terms on contact tracing, testing and providing support. 
With high school athletics restarting, are there any special steps being taken to provide timely support if + cases/exposure arise? 
There is guidance available for high school athletic and sporting events. We encourage the use of that guidance. We continue to do what we do in terms of identifying positive cases and notifying contacts. All of those processes are in place whether at state or local level and they aid in identifying individuals and reducing spread whether it’s at an athletic event, group event or other activities. 
What is the situation at the Polk County jail, and what is the effect of the influx of people being arrested at protests? Are they at risk of catching the virus at the jail?Those who have been detained as a part of the protests are quickly processed and released. There is minimal exposure. There are isolation areas in the jail for those who disclose COVID-19 positive status or are tested positive while at the jail. 
What is the current testing situation in Polk?  Is it easy to get upon request (symptoms or no symptoms) or do there continue to be issues with availability? 
As of right now, the clinics and hospitals still have a tight prioritization list of how they are testing people. Test Iowa is still available for asymptomatic people. The situation remains very fluid and will continue to do so for quite a while. What we are hearing from Test Iowa is that people can schedule out 3 days from the day they schedule their appointment. The testing may not be immediate but it should be within 3 days when you try to schedule. If you can’t get a date that works for you, try again and refill out the questionnaire. 
Where is the guidance for sports teams and what to do if some tests positive?https://www.polkcountyiowa.gov/media/dydi1cer/pchd-athletic-guidance.pdfSeveral companies are offering contact tracing for businesses, what are your thoughts?  Are you currently working with any outside agencies to facilitate contact tracing?The Health Department is not currently working with any outside organizations for contact tracing. Businesses have the opportunity to utilize this service. We recommend to vet these companies and do any appropriate agreements or contracts because we are aware of scams out there.Can the local emergency management and public health agencies encourage the adoption or mandate of paid sick leave or temporary unemployment benefit policies to make "stay at home if you're sick" possible?We can encourage it but we cannot mandate it. That is a private business/sector decision. It is also a legislative decision. It is beyond what public health or emergency management can do.Is there any new advice or updates about safety of swimming pools?  There is nothing new. The CDC continues to put out guidance so continue to visit their website.Are there data show more serious outcomes locally from strokes, heart attacks, etc.?They are just seeing an uptick in cases or the equity of patients in the EMS field.What Phase is Polk County in?  How is this determined?  Can you review that process?
 
Referencing the Phases from the CDC determining when we can advance, for example larger group sizes.Our governor provides that guidance with regards to reopening and group sizes in Iowa.Recommendations from the CDC for Covid 19 positive individuals that are Asymptomatic is the 10 days from onset & 72 hours symptom free ALONG with 2 Negative test > or = 24 hours apart to ensure individuals do not still carry the virus.  Some local clinics and hospitals are not doing this or providing documentation employees can return to work.  As an employer, how can we ensure that employee is recovered and no longer has a potential to infect other employees?  OSHA also states that employers shall follow CDC guidelines and in return those guidelines are not being met by local care facilities.The CDC offers two different strategies in regards to when a person can return to activities and work. The test based strategy is one that is offered and that one is suggested to be employed based on conditions in your community with regards to the degree of illness and the availability of testing.The other strategy is to use the 10/R/3 strategy.In relation to illness guidelines, how do we help people triage whether a symptom is truly covid or not likely covid?  Examples:  nausea and diarrhea—return 24hrs after resolved, 72hrs after resolved, 10 days since onset + 72hrs resolved?  Or does answer depend on community transmission level, amt of exposure in community, etc. Do we say even 1 symptom counts as possible covid or say it has to be more than 1 or does it depend on symptom (e.g. loss of smell counts but headache is wait and see)? Hard questions to answer but especially given asymptomatic folks, these are the types of questions employers are being asked to answer daily and schools will be in same boat.If you are ill, the important thing is to self-isolate whether it is COVID-19 or something type of illness. Continue to monitor and watch for symptoms of COVID-19. Most importantly seeking the guidance and counsel of your health care provider. If you do not have one, guidance from public health to make some type of determination about what you are dealing regarding an illness and what types of testing are needed based on your symptoms.Last day to place supply orders through PCEMA is July 7.

Please consider lifting those restrictions that require employees to have a doctor's excuse for illness.  The clinicians are currently inundated with serious illnesses, COVID-19 tests for those showing symptoms of the illness and other issues.  They will not be able to take the time to write a note for your employee.  Also you do not want your employee visiting a clinic where people displaying symptoms of COVID-19 have gone to get tested. If you have employees that have pre-existing conditions making them susceptible to serious consequences from contracting COVID-19, we are asking you to make every effort to allow them to work from home or allow them to take sick time to remain safe during this crisis. There are some preventative measures that can be taken to help keep you and your employees safe.  Consider having your employees take their temperature before they come to work and when they get home from work.  Any temperature over 100.4 degrees should be reported to a supervisor and that employee should stay home.  Consider increasing cleaning of work surfaces at your facilities.  Cleaning should take place frequently throughout the day.  Any commercial cleaner is effective as is a mix of bleach and water. Increase social distancing at your workplace.  Consider allowing work from home where possible.  Limit sharing of equipment and using common workstations, break areas, etc. Finally, if you have an employee that displays any of the symptoms of COVID-19 (persistent cough, fever greater than 100.4, sore throat) they should be sent home immediately and advised to contact their medical provider.  Those in immediate contact with that employee should be considered for self quarantine and observation. COVID-19 Testing Considerations for BusinessesIowa Guidance for Senior Centers and Adult Day ProgramsBest Practices tips for greenhouses and nurseries from Illinois Green Industry AssociationTips to prevent COVID-19 at greenhouses and nurseries from Michigan State UniversityImplementation of Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 TransmissionUSDA COVID-19 Federal Rural Resource Guide OSHA’s Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19IDPH Resources CDC ResourcesCDC Resources for Businesses and EmployersCOVID-19 Cleaning ProductsInitiating Planning SectionTelework GuidanceContinuity of Operations GuidanceActions for Infrastructure Protection and Supply Chains during COVID-19Business Continuity Planning Guidance
